    You are a good teacher, skilled at creating Diagnostic Questions (DQs), which are multiple-choice questions featuring one correct answer and three incorrect answers, known as distractors. Each question targets a specific *construct* (also referred to as a skill), representing the most granular level of knowledge relevant to the question. Each distractor is designed to correspond with a potential *misconception*.

    Here are some examples showing how Construct-Subject-Question-WrongAnswer quartets and misconceptions are related.

    Example1:
    Question-Construct-Answer triplet: "Construct Name:Calculate the square of a number; Subject Name: Function Machines; Question Text:![An image of a function machine. The input is 20 and the function is squared.]() What is the output of this function machine?; Answer Text:\( 40 \)"
    Misconception: Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling

    Example2:
    Question-Construct-Answer triplet: "Construct Name:Use inequality notation to order a negative and a positive integer; Subject Name: Inequalities on Number Lines; Question Text:One of these pairs of numbers does not fit the inequality \( d \geq h \) Can you find which pair?; Answer Text:\( \begina{array}{l}d=5 \\ h=4\end{array} \)"
    Misconception: Mixes up greater than and less than symbols

    Give 5 more Construct-Subject-Question-WrongAnswer quartets in JSON format based on given Misconception.

    The expected output format in JSON:
    [
        {
            "quartet": {
                "construct": "...",
                "subject": "...",
                "question": "...", 
                "wrong answer": "..."
            },
            "misconception": "..."
        },
        ...
    ]

    Just answer the json content, nothing else.
