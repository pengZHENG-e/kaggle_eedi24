Please note that the values are correct in this example. It travels from 40 kilometers (at 4 hours) to 120 kilometers (at 10 hours), and 120 kilometers - 40 kilometers = 80 kilometers, but 80 kilometers wasn't one of the answer option I had provided before.

There are 5 blue marbles and 2 green marbles in a jar. Liam picks a green marble out and then replaces it. He then has a second pick. What is the probability the second pick is also a green marble?

The correct answer is A, with an answer text of (2/7) and no misconception listed.

The incorrect answers are:

* B: (2/6) - This answer assumes that the marble has not been replaced in a probability question where it has actually been replaced.
* D: (1/6) - This answer also assumes that the marble has not been replaced in a probability question where it has actually been replaced.

This question also tests the students' ability to compare pie charts and understand that the size of the sector in a pie chart is relative to the total it represents, rather than just its visual appearance. The correct answer is School B, where more students play sports, but this can only be determined by considering the total number of students in each school.

This example presents a similar scenario, where the student is asked to calculate the total number of books a bookshelf can hold, given the number of shelves and the number of books each shelf can hold. The misconceptions are the same as in the original example, with the correct answer being the multiplication of the two numbers.

This example maintains the same format and misconceptions as the original question. The correct answer is still the fraction that represents the correct part of the model, and the misconceptions are still related to incorrectly identifying the whole or part of the model.

Misconception 1310/1869:

Note: I've generated a new expression that requires the use of BIDMAS, and the answer choices have the same misconceptions as the original example.

]

Note that I've maintained the same format and misconceptions as the original example, and generated a new question and answers.

Misconception 1318/1869:
Here is another example of the same question format and misconceptions:

```
[
    {
        "question": {

            "Subject": "Factors and Highest Common Factor",
            "Question": "\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

\hline Not a factor of \( 24 \) & C & D \\
\hline
\end{tabular} In which box should you place \( \mathbf{1 2} \) ?"
        },
        "answers": {
            "Answer_A": {
                "Answer_text": "A",
                "Misconception": "nan"
            },
            "Answer_B": {
                "Answer_text": "B",
                "Misconception": "nan"
            },
            "Answer_C": {
                "Answer_text": "C",
                "Misconception": "nan"
            },
            "Answer_D": {

                "Misconception": "Does not understand the term factor"
            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "B"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is again "B", as 12 is a factor of 24 but not a multiple of 3. The misconceptions for each answer remain the same as in the original question.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Misconception 1322/1869:
Here is another example in the same format:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "ConstructName": "Given the sector angle on a pie chart, calculate the frequency of a group",
            "Subject": "Pie Chart",

        },
        "answers": {
            "Answer_A": {
                "Answer_text": "\( 45 \)",
                "Misconception": "nan"
            },
            "Answer_B": {
                "Answer_text": "\( 90 \)",
                "Misconception": "Believes the angle in a pie chart sector is equal to the frequency"

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "A"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is A, `$ 45 $`, because the sector angle for Blue is $ 45 $ degrees, and there are $ 15 $ students who chose Blue, so the frequency of Red can be calculated accordingly. The misconception for answer B is the same, believing that the angle in a pie chart sector is equal to the frequency.

Note that the Correct Answer is indeed "A", since the correct calculation is:

\(
\frac{2}{5}+\frac{3}{8} = \frac{16}{40}+\frac{15}{40} = \frac{31}{40}
\)

So the correct replacement for the star is 31.

In this example, the correct answer is C, which corresponds to the probability of 0.3 on the number line. The misconception for answer C is the same as before, which is converting a fraction to a decimal by using the denominator after the decimal point.

In this example, the question is to add four fractions: `2/5`, `1/6`, `3/5`, and `2/6`. The correct answer is not provided, but it would require finding a common denominator and adding the fractions correctly.

The misconceptions are maintained as follows:

* Answer A: Forgets to change the numerators when finding equivalent fractions
* Answer B: When adding fractions, adds the numerators and denominators
* Answer C: No misconception specified
* Answer D: No misconception specified

        },
        "Correct_Answer": "A"
    }

```

In this example, the correct solution is `x = 3`, which is Answer A. Answer B has the misconception of subtracting instead of adding when using inverse operations to solve the equation, which results in the incorrect answer `x = -2`.

Note that the correct answer is again "C" since both Alex and Ben are using a correct application of the distributive property of multiplication to arrive at the correct answer.

This example has the same format and misconceptions as the original question. The correct answer is again Ben, who correctly simplified the algebraic fraction by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator. Alex's mistake was only applying the division to one of the terms in the numerator.

In this example, the question asks how many degrees clockwise you need to turn to move from facing North to facing East, and the correct answer is `90^{\circ}`. The misconception for Answer A is that it mixes up clockwise and anticlockwise, which is similar to the misconception in the original example.

Misconception 1499/1869:
Here is another example of the same question type with different values and the same misconceptions:

                "Misconception": "Does not consider the denominator when adding/ subtracting fractions. Adds/subtracts the numerator and makes the denominator the one with the highest value."

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "D"
    }
]
```

Let me explain each answer and its corresponding misconception:

* Answer A: `(5/16)` - subtracts the numerators and denominators (`7 - 2 = 5` and `12 - 4 = 8`)
* Answer B: `(5/12)` - does not consider the denominator when adding/subtracting fractions, adds/subtracts the numerator and makes the denominator the one with the highest value (`7 - 2 = 5` and uses the highest denominator `12`)
* Answer C: `(9/12)` - adds instead of subtracts (`7 + 2 = 9` and uses the same denominator `12`)
* Answer D: `(3/12)` - correct answer, subtracts the fractions correctly (`7/12 - 2/4 = 3/12`)

Note that the question image is now a hexagonal pyramid, and the correct net is a single hexagon with six triangles. The misconceptions for each answer remain the same as before.

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "B"
    }
]

Note: The correct answer is B because the number of circles in the sequence is constant (1 circle per term), so doubling the number of terms will not change the number of circles. On the other hand, the number of legs in the sequence is increasing by 1 each term, so doubling the number of terms will indeed double the number of legs.

This example maintains the same format and misconceptions as the original question, but with a different scenario: \( h \) increases quickly at first, then slows down, then increases quickly again.

Note that I've maintained the same format and structure as the original example, with new values for the quadratic expression and answer options. The misconception for each answer option remains the same as before.

This example maintains the same format and misconceptions as the original question, but with new fractions: 2/3 and 1/4. The correct answer is still B, with a value of 11/12. The misconceptions for each answer option remain the same.

Note that I've changed the numbers and operation, but maintained the same format and misconceptions.

Misconception 1550/1869:
Here's another example with the same format and misconceptions:


[
    {

Who is correct?"

            "Answer_A": {

            },

                "Misconception": "nan"

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "A"
    }
]

In this example, Alex and Emma are arguing about the product of \( 2^{3} \) and \( 5^{3} \). Alex says the correct answer is 2000, while Emma thinks it's \( 10^{6} \). The correct answer is Alex, as the product of \( 2^{3} \) and \( 5^{3} \) is indeed 2000. Emma's mistake is based on the misconception that when multiplying numbers with different bases, you multiply the powers and multiply the base numbers, which is not correct.

```

In this example, the correct calculation is:

(36 + 48) / 3 = 84 / 3 = 28

But the distractors are based on the same misconceptions as before:

* Answer A: correct answer (42 is not the correct answer, but there is no specific misconception)
* Answer B: multiplies rather than divides (144 is the product of 36, 48, and 3, rather than the result of the division)
* Answer C: does not interpret the correct order of operations in a fraction when there is an addition on the numerator (68 is not the result of any correct calculation)
* Answer D: no specific misconception (38 is not the correct answer, but there is no specific misconception)

In this example, the polygon Q is rotated 180° about the point (-3, -3), and students are asked to identify where the red point will be on the rotated shape. The misconceptions for each answer remain the same as in the original example.

Misconception 1654/1869:
Here's another example of a question based on the same misconceptions:

In this example, the question is asking for the value of y when x is 2, given the equation y = 2/x. The correct answer is 1, which replaces the star in the table. The misconceptions remain the same as in the original question.

Note: I maintained the same format and misconceptions as the original example, and generated a new question with different dimensions.

Misconception 1779/1869:
Here is another example of the same question format and misconceptions:

```

Note that I've kept the same format and misconceptions, but changed the shape to a pyramid and the question to ask about the number of edges.

Note: The question and answers are similar to the original, but with different variables and numbers. The misconceptions remain the same.

In this example, the correct answer is 5, since the cube root of 125 is 5.

In this example, the correct answer is indeed 4, because \( \sqrt[4]{256} = 4 \). The misconceptions for each answer are the same as before: Answer B divides the number by the order of the root (in this case, 256 ÷ 4 = 64), Answer C multiplies the number by the root power (in this case, 256 × 4 = 1024), and Answer D has no clear misconception.

Here is another example in the same format:

        "Correct_Answer": "C"
    }

Note: The correct answer is still C, as both Alex and Sam's functions are correct. Alex's function \( ×5 \) represents the multiplication of the input x by 5, and Sam's function \( +4x \) is not a correct representation of the given function machine, but if it were \( +0x \) it would be correct, so the misconception is still related to not understanding when like terms can be collected.
