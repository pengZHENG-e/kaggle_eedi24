Note: To generate the new example I have used the same misconceptions provided, and changed the dataset of numbers to `1,2,3,6,8,10` and in consequence generated new answers based on those numbers:

- For answer A, a common or central number not necessarily the actual median.
- For answer B, the midpoint value lower than the actual midpoint between two central values (Note in this case 4 and 5 are the middle values but since the middle value is higher in this example a smaller number was picked for this choice A).
- For answer C, correct answer 4.5 the actual midpoint (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5.
- For answer D, a incorrect answer generated following the misconception described, therefore a very high number (`8`) was used for this incorrect choice, note high values were intentionally chosen as high values can emphasize no sorting was applied "on this generated incorrect response only for illustration proposes".

Note: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. In the above example, both Emma and Michael's sequences follow the Fibonacci pattern, which confirms that the correct answer is C. The starting numbers of the sequence do not necessarily have to be 1 and 1.

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "B"
    }
]

Here's the explanation for the correct answer: 
- The cost for the first 50 books is 50 * £10 = £500.
- The cost for the remaining 350 books is 350 * £8 = £2800.
- Total cost is £500 + £2800 = £3300, then you need to round to the correct answer based on your results

 The correct answer is B, because when rounding \( \mathbf{2 4 7 3 . 5} \) to the nearest ten, the number in the ones place (3) is accompanied by a 5 in the decimal place. Since this is exactly halfway between 2470 and 2480, and we round up when numbers are exactly halfway, this rounds to 2470.

This new example has the same question structure, but the frequency table represents the number of books sold by a bookstore. Answer_D (25) is the correct answer because it correctly adds the total frequencies: 3 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17 is incorrect so to get the total of 25 it should be 3*1+2*2+4*3+6*4+2*5 which gives 3+4+12+24+10=53  is incorrect so using the average 17+25 = 42/2 = 21 is stil incorrect 3+8 = 11+6+ 8 = 25

Note: To solve for x in the given equation, we would first substitute y=0 and solve for x. 

\[
0=\frac{1}{4} x - 2
\]

Adding 2 to both sides:

\[
2=\frac{1}{4} x 
\]

Multiplying both sides by 4:

\[
8=x
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is 8 (Answer_C).

double the number of blocks in the \( 4^{\text {th }} \) term.

David says the number of blocks in each row in the \( 8^{\text {th }} \) term will be 
double the number of blocks in each row in the \( 4^{\text {th }} \) term, plus 2 extra blocks.

                "Answer_text": "Both Samantha and David",
                "Misconception": "Believes there is a multiplicative relationship between values of terms in a linear sequence e.g. 10th term is double 5th term"

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "B"
    }
]

Note that in this example, David is correct because the number of blocks in each row in the 8th term will be double the number of blocks in each row in the 4th term (8 blocks in the 4th term becomes 16 blocks in the 8th term), but Samantha is incorrect because the total number of blocks in the sequence is not simply double the number of blocks in the 4th term.

Please note that there is a subtle difference in the "Misconception" for answers B and C. A rectangle is indeed a type of parallelogram but for this example, the misconception has been simplified to not remember that a rectangle has equal opposite sides and four right angles, although the original statement (does not remember that a rhombus has equal sides) for the previous question has been modified slightly for consistency and in line with the new prompt information.
Alternatively, the example can be changed as follows for maintaining the previous question-like misconceptions:

Misconception 1093/1869:
Here is another example of a question with the same misconceptions:

```

                "Misconception": "nan"
            },
            "Answer_B": {

                "Misconception": "Believes the mode is the frequency rather than the value/group"

    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is Yellow, which is the color with the highest frequency. The misconceptions are the same as in the original question: Answer B calculates the median instead of the mode, Answer C thinks the mode is the frequency rather than the value/group, and Answer D looks at all values instead of frequencies to find the highest number.

Note that I've maintained the same format and misconceptions as the original example, but with a new question and graph.

Misconception 1209/1869:
Here's another example:

This example maintains the same format and misconceptions as the original, but with a new sequence of numbers and answer options. The correct answer is still "The triangle numbers", but the misconceptions of the other answers are similar to the original (e.g. believing pentagonal numbers are triangle numbers, etc.).

Misconception 1210/1869:
Here is another example in the same format:

[

Note that the correct answer is B in this case, unlike the original example where the correct answer was A.

Misconception 1211/1869:
Here is another example of the same question format with the same misconceptions:

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "C"
    }
]
```

Note that I've changed the dimensions of the cuboid, the label of the face, and the shading color, but the misconceptions and format remain the same.

Misconception 1212/1869:
Here is another example:

[

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "C"
    }
]

In this example, the question asks about a square, which is also a type of rhombus. The correct answer is "Both Tom and Katie" because a square is indeed a rhombus, but the misconception for this answer choice is "Does not know the properties of a square".

    }
]
```

In this example, Alex is using the distributive property to break down the multiplication into \( 24 \times 10 \) and \( 24 \times 8 \), and then adding the results. Sam is using the doubling and multiplying by 2 strategy to calculate \( 12 \times 18 \) and then doubling the result. Both methods are correct, so both Alex and Sam would get the correct answer.

In this example, the correct answer is 2^3 = 8, but the other options reflect the same misconceptions as before:

* Answer A adds the index 3 to the number 2, getting 5.
* Answer B multiplies the number 2 by the index 3, getting 4 (which is actually 2^2, not 2^3).
* Answer D writes the index 3 as a digit on the end of the number 2, getting 23.

```

Note that I've kept the same format and misconceptions, but changed the diagram and the values in the question. The correct answer is still A, which corresponds to the correct value of angle x, which is equal to 67 degrees due to vertically opposite angles being equal.

Note that the new question has a circle with three equal sectors, one of which is shaded and then split into two equal parts, with one of those parts shaded. The correct answer is still the one where the student understands the concept of equal parts and the denominator correctly.

In this example, the composite shape is a square "C" shape made from two rectangles. The base of the shape is 8cm long, the vertical height of the whole shape is 10cm, the horizontal width of the top part of the shape is 3cm, and the vertical height of the bottom rectangle is 6cm. The top-handed rectangle is shaded blue. The student is asked to find the area of the shaded section.

In this new example, the line of reflection is `x=3`, and the point `F` is located at `(3,5)`. The correct reflection of `F` is `(6,5)`, but the other options reflect common misconceptions about reflection in a vertical line.

This example presents the same misconceptions for each answer option, but with a different shape (an 8-sided "C shape" polygon) and a different rotation (180 degrees).

            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "A"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is `x = 2/3`, which can be obtained by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 12. The misconceptions for each answer option are the same as before:

* Answer B misconceives by swapping the dividend and divisor to get an integer answer.
* Answer D misconceives by using the same operation (in this case, subtraction) rather than the inverse operation (addition) to solve the equation.

This example has the same format and misconceptions as the original question, but with a different number to be rounded.

This example also tests the probability of a single event, but with a six-sided die instead of a spinner. The correct answer is 25% since there are two red faces out of six possible outcomes. The misconceptions are similar to the original example.

In this example, the question is asking for the length of the side marked `x` in a triangle constructed using the side-angle-side method. The correct answer is `4 cm`.

Note that the numbers in the question have been changed, but the misconceptions and answer formats remain the same.

Misconception 1865/1869:
Here is another example in the same format:

Let me know if you'd like me to generate another example!

Misconception 1867/1869:
Here is another example:

This example maintains the same format and misconceptions as the original question, but with a new scenario and diagram.

Misconception 1868/1869:
Here is another example of the same format and misconceptions:

```
[

        "question": {

            "Question": "May and Ryan are arguing about how to fully describe the rotation from shape \( R \) to shape \( S \)

Who is correct? ![A coordinate grid with two triangles drawn on it and a centre of rotation marked on, two spaces to the right and three spaces down from the origin. Triangle R has the coordinates: (2,5) (4,5) and (3,3). Triangle S has the coordinates: (0,2) (0,0) and (-1,-1).]()"

                "Misconception": "Forgets to give the centre of rotation"
            },
            "Answer_D": {
                "Answer_text": "Neither is correct",
                "Misconception": "Does not know about the + notation for directions in rotations"
            }
        },
        "Correct_Answer": "B"
    }

```

This example has the same format and misconceptions as the original question, but with a new diagram and new arguments from May and Ryan.
