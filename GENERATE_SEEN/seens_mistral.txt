Tom and Katie are discussing this sequence. ![The first 3 patterns in a sequence are shown. The first pattern is a blue rectangle with 6 yellow circles attached to its perimeter: 2 circles on each of the longer sides and 1 circle on each of the shorter sides.
Pattern 2 is made up of 2 blue rectangles, attached together in a row by their short edges. There are also 10 yellow circles in this pattern, attached to the perimeter of the rectangles: 2 circles on every longer side of each rectangle and 1 circle on each of the two free shorter sides (i.e. that are not attached to the other rectangle).
Pattern 3 is made up of 3 blue rectangles, attached together in a row by their short edges. There are also 14 yellow circles in this pattern, attached to the perimeter of the rectangles: 2 circles on every longer side of each rectangle and 1 circle on each of the two free shorter sides (i.e. that are not attached to another rectangle).]() Tom says the number of circles in the \( 10^{\text {th }} \) term will be
double the number of circles in the \( 5^{\text {th }} \) term.
