Misconception 218: Does not interpret a sloping gradient as a change in rate
Expanded misconception:
Does not correctly interpret a sloping gradient as a rate of change or does not apply an understanding of the relationship between the gradient of a line and the rate at which a quantity is changing.

Misconception 219: Does not know that a right angle is 90 degrees
Expanded misconception:
Demonstrates a limited understanding of standard angle measurements, specifically failing to recognize that a right angle is defined as exactly 90 degrees, and may inaccurately estimate or confuse it with other common angle measurements.

Misconception 220: Only multiplies the first term in the expansion of a bracket
Expanded misconception:
Fails to fully distribute or apply the multiplication across all terms when expanding brackets or parentheses in algebraic expressions.

Misconception 221: Thinks ratios are written as 1:total
Expanded misconception:
Fails to conceptually distinguish between ratios and proportions, mistakenly believes that ratios are written as 'part to total' (e.g., 1:total) rather than 'part to part' or uses this misconception when interpreting or constructing ratio statements.

Misconception 222: Does not know the meaning of absolute value
Expanded misconception:
Does not understand the concept of absolute value, specifically failing to recognize that the absolute value of a number is its non-negative magnitude, often resulting in incorrect calculations or sign handling when absolute value is involved.

Misconception 223: Mixes up cubing with multiplying by 10
Expanded misconception:
Misapplies exponentiation concepts, specifically mistaking cubing (raising to the power of 3) with raising to the power of an additive factor (e.g., multiplying by 10, as in squaring and then multiplying by 10) or incorrectly applying patterns of multiplying by powers of 10.

Misconception 224: Forgets to swap the sign of roots when placing into brackets
Expanded misconception:
Fails to apply proper manipulation of signs to radicals or roots, especially when moving them within equations, as in missing signs, misapplying properties of odd or even roots, or incorrectly handling radicals when changing the order of operations within expressions or equations.

Misconception 225: Confuses frequency of one class with cumulative frequency
Expanded misconception:
Confuses frequency of one class with cumulative frequency or interprets the representation of discrete data as continuous, suggesting a lack of understanding in the difference between individual class frequency and aggregated class frequencies, which may lead to incorrect inferences in data analysis and interpretation.

Misconception 226: Thinks rectangles have line symmetry in the diagonals 
Expanded misconception:
Applies line symmetry to incorrect axes, specifically thinking that rectangles have line symmetry in the diagonals when, in fact, they have line symmetry in the vertical and horizontal axes.

Misconception 227: Ignores a more than question and just states one of the values
Expanded misconception:
Fails to consider that the question is asking for a result or product outside of the individual components, responding as if the question was inquiring about one of the addends, factors, or terms instead of the operation's outcome.

Misconception 228: Divides rather than subtracts when given the command 'less than'
Expanded misconception:
Misinterprets or confuses mathematical operations, specifically dividing when the operation instructed is subtraction, indicated by words or symbols such as 'less than' (-), 'minus,' or 'subtract,' potentially due to a lack of understanding of the distinction between these operations or difficulty in translating word problems into mathematical expressions.

Misconception 229: Does not account for scale on diagram
Expanded misconception:
Fails to consider the proportion or scale of a diagram, figure, or graph when interpreting or using the information provided, often leading to incorrect calculations, measurements, or conclusions.

Misconception 230: Thinks 1l = 1 cubic metre
Expanded misconception:
Fails to distinguish between units of capacity/volume (e.g. litres) and units of cubic measurement (e.g. cubic metres), often incorrectly assuming 1 litre (L) is equivalent to 1 cubic metre (mÂ³) or vice versa.

Misconception 231: Thinks we can't write an equivalent multiplication sum for a division sum by using a reciprocal
Expanded misconception:
Fails to apply the concept of multiplicative inverse to rewrite division as equivalent multiplication, omitting or incorrectly using the reciprocal of the divisor.

Misconception 232: When dividing by a fraction, switches to multiplication without also using the reciprocal
Expanded misconception:
Fails to use the reciprocal when dividing by a fraction.

Misconception 233: Cannot estimate the relative volume order, for different objects
Expanded misconception:
Cannot comprehend or accurately estimate the relative volume or quantity orders, such as comparing standard units of measurement, understanding proportional relationships, or recognizing scaling differences among various objects.

Misconception 234: Subtracts instead of adds
Expanded misconception:
"Executes incorrect arithmetic operation or order of operations, specifically substituting addition with subtraction or neglecting to carry out the intended addition, leading to an incorrect calculation or equation result."

Misconception 235: Thinks adjacent angles are equal
Expanded misconception:
Thinks adjacent angles are equal and fails to apply correct angle properties, ignoring the type of adjacent angles (complementary, supplementary, linear pair, vertical angles, or corresponding angles), or mistakenly assumes that all adjacent angles in a specific configuration or figure are equal without verifying angle relationships.

Misconception 236: Thinks corresponding angles sum to 180 degrees
Expanded misconception:
Incorrectly assumes that all pairs of corresponding angles are supplementary (sum to 180 degrees) without considering whether the lines are parallel or the specific angle relationships involved.

Misconception 237: Believes a line of best fit can be drawn on a scatter graph with no relationship or correlation
Expanded misconception:
Believes that a line of best fit can be drawn on a scatter graph with no apparent relationship or correlation between the variables, or mistakenly infers causation or correlation from an apparent random or scattered pattern, rather than recognizing a lack of association or an insignificant correlation.

Misconception 238: When finding the mean of the data in a stem and leaf diagram, thinks you find the mean of the stem numbers
Expanded misconception:
When finding the mean of the data in a stem and leaf diagram, incorrectly thinks you find the mean by averaging the stem numbers only, or disregarding the actual leaf values, or misunderstanding the relationship between the stem and leaf values.

Misconception 239: Finds a common multiple but not the lowest common multiple
Expanded misconception:
Finds a common multiple but not the lowest common multiple, often indicating a lack of understanding of the nuances of multiples and least common multiples (LCMs) or failure to apply shortcuts to simplify the calculation of LCMs.
