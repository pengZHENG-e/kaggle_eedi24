During the journey, she travelled a total distance of 1200m. 
What are the coordinates of the marked point? 
![The vertical axis of the graph is labelled Speed (m/s) and has a scale marked from 0 to 10 in even steps. The horizontal axis is labelled Time (mins) and has a scale marked from 0 to 20 in even steps. The graph is a horizontal line that goes from point (0,6) and touches the Time axis at 10 minutes.
The marked point is at 8 minutes on the Time axis and at 6 on the Speed axis.]

\( A \) is the midpoint between points \( B \) and \( C \).
Alex says if you know the location of \( A \) only, then there is more than one possible location for \( B \) and \( C \).
Ben says if you only know the locations of \( A \) and \( B \), then there is more than one possible location for \( C \).
