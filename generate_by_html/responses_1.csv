During that time he travelled at a speed of \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \).
What are the coordinates of the marked point? ![The vertical axis of the graph is labelled Distance (m) and has a scale marked from 0 to 60 in even steps. The horizontal axis is labelled Time (secs) and has no scale marked on it. The graph is a straight line that goes from point (0,60) and touches the Time axis three squares from the origin (0,0).
The marked point is one square in on the Time axis and at 40 on the Distance axis.]()

<Question>
![A grid of 8 squares across and 8 squares up. A blue horizontal line goes from the left to the right of the grid, it is 3 squares down from the top of the grid. A green triangle (2 squares width and 3 squares height) is drawn above the blue line, with its bottom side on the blue line.  The left side of the triangle is 2 squares left from the left edge of the grid. The top vertex of the triangle is marked with the letter R, which is 1 square down from the top of the grid on the left edge of the grid. The bottom left vertex of the triangle is marked with the letter S, which is 2 squares left from the left edge of the grid on the blue line. ]() Sarah and Alex are discussing reflections.

Sarah says if you reflect the triangle in the horizontal line, Point \( R \) stays in the same position.

Alex says if you reflect the triangle in the horizontal line, Point \( S \) stays in the same position.

![A grid of 7 squares across and 7 squares up. A red vertical line goes from the bottom to the top of the grid, it is 4 squares left from the edge of the grid. An orange rectangle (3 squares width and 2 squares height) is drawn to the left of the red line, with its right-hand side on the red line.  The bottom side of the rectangle is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid. The bottom left corner of the rectangle is marked with the letter P, which is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid and 3 squares to the left of the red line. The bottom right corner of the rectangle is marked with the letter Q, which is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid on the red line. ]() Tom and Katie are discussing reflections
