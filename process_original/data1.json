The bottom left corner of the rectangle is marked with a tiny blue circle.\nA letter \"A\" is marking a point directly above the tiny blue circle, 3 squares above the red line. A letter \"B\" is marking a point directly above the tiny blue circle, 2 squares above the red line. A letter \"C\" is marking a point directly above the tiny blue circle, 1 square above the red line.
