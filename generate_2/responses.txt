Misconception 10/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "The table shows the cost of buying different numbers of pens. What is the cost of buying 5 pens?",
            "construct": "Substitute positive integer values into formulae involving powers or roots",

        "misconception": "Thinks you can find missing values in a given table by treating the row as linear and adding on the difference between the first two values given."
    }
]
```

Here's the question:

The table shows the cost of buying different numbers of pens.

| Number of pens | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (£) | 5 | 10 | 15 | ? |

What is the cost of buying 5 pens?

A) 20
B) 25
C) 30
D) 35

The correct answer is B) 25, which requires substituting the value 5 into the formula `cost = 5 × number of pens`. The distractor A) 20 is designed to appeal to the misconception that the cost increases linearly by adding £5 each time, while distractors C) 30 and D) 35 are designed to appeal to more random or careless errors.

Misconception 66/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same Misconception:

[
    {

            "construct": "Count backwards from a given number",
            "answer": "246"
        },
        "misconception": "Counts the starting number when counting backwards"
    }
]

Let me explain this question:

* The question asks Sarah to count backwards from 247, which requires her to decrease the number by 1.
* The correct answer is 246, which is the result of decreasing 247 by 1.
* The misconception being targeted is the idea that Sarah will say the starting number (247) when counting backwards, rather than decreasing it by 1. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which would include options like "247" (the starting number), "249" (increasing the number instead of decreasing), and "245" (decreasing the number by 2 instead of 1).

Misconception 67/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is x = 8, but the distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect the misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse. For instance, one distractor might be x = -3, which would result from adding 5 to both sides of the equation instead of adding 5 to both sides and then subtracting x from both sides.

        },
        "misconception": "Gives a rounded whole number instead of a decimal"
    }
]

Let me explain the question and its components:

* The question text asks the student to convert a length from metres to kilometres.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to convert between metres and kilometres, which is a specific skill or knowledge component.
* The correct answer is 0.0035, which requires the student to perform the conversion accurately.
* The misconception being targeted is that the student might give a rounded whole number instead of a decimal, such as 0 or 1, rather than the correct decimal value.

        },
        "misconception": "When dividing a fraction by an integer, divides both the numerator and denominator by the integer"
    }
]
```

Let me explain this example:

**Question**: The question asks the student to calculate `3/6 ÷ 3`.

**Construct**: The construct targeted by this question is still "Divide proper fractions in the form: Fraction ÷ Integer", which means the student should understand how to divide a proper fraction by an integer.

**Answer**: The correct answer is `1`, which can be obtained by dividing `3/6` by `3`.

**Misconception**: The misconception targeted by this question is the same as before: "When dividing a fraction by an integer, divides both the numerator and denominator by the integer". This misconception might lead a student to think that the correct answer is `1/2` (dividing both numerator and denominator by `3`), which is incorrect.

        },
        "misconception": "Confuses scalene and right angle triangles"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question presents a multiple-choice option with three distractors that might tempt students who confuse scalene and right-angled triangles:

A) Isosceles triangle
B) Equilateral triangle
C) Scalene triangle
D) None of the above

Misconception 104/4370:

Note: The figure shows a right triangle △ABC with ∠B = 90°, but the triangle is rotated so that the right angle is not at the bottom left or right.

        },
        "misconception": "Only multiplies the first term in the expansion of a bracket"
    }
]

Here's a breakdown of the question:

* The question text describes a function machine with an input of 2x + 1, and the machine multiplies the input by 2.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to find the output of a function machine given an algebraic input.
* The correct answer is 4x + 2, which is the result of multiplying the input by 2.
* The misconception being addressed is the idea that the machine only multiplies the first term in the expansion of a bracket, which would result in an incorrect answer of 4x + 1.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra"
    }
]

Here's a breakdown of the question:

* The question stem asks students to identify the correct bar model representation of the equation 3x.
* The correct answer is "Three identical parts, each labelled x", which is a bar model with three identical parts, each labelled x, representing the equation 3x.
* The distractors (not shown) would be other incorrect bar models, such as:
	+ A bar model with one part labelled 3x (misconception: students think the label should be the product, not the variable)
	+ A bar model with three parts, each labelled 1x (misconception: students think the number of parts corresponds to the coefficient, but don't understand the concept of identical parts)
	+ A bar model with one part labelled x, with an arrow indicating multiplication by 3 (misconception: students think the arrow represents multiplication, rather than using identical parts)

The misconception targeted by this question is still "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra", as students may struggle to represent equations using bar models due to a lack of understanding of the concept.

Misconception 110/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra"
    }
]

This question has four options:

A) 
```
  +-----+-----+-----+
  | 3  | x  | x  | x  |
  +-----+-----+-----+
```
B) 
```
  +-----+-----+-----+

```
C) 
```
  +-----+-----+-----+
  | 6  | x  | x  | x  |
  +-----+-----+-----+
```
D) None of the above

The correct answer is D) None of the above, because none of the options correctly represent the equation 3x = 6 using a bar model. The other options are designed to correspond with potential misconceptions about bar modeling in algebra.

            "answer": "3"
        },

    }

Let me explain the thought process behind creating this question:

* The question text presents a scenario where a function machine performs two operations (×2 and +5) in a specific order, and the output is 11.
* The construct targeted is the same as in the previous example: "Determine the input of a double function machine used to create an algebraic expression".
* The correct answer is 3, because the input must be multiplied by 2 and then have 5 added to it to result in 11.
* The misconception this question is designed to detect is "Has completed only one of the two operations". This means that students who hold this misconception might try to solve for the input by only considering one of the operations, rather than both.

Misconception 116/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "input → 2x - 4 → × 2 → 4x - 12 What is the input of this function machine?",
            "construct": "Determine the input of a double function machine used to create an algebraic expression",
            "answer": "x - 2"
        },
        "misconception": "Has completed only one of the two operations."
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the same construct as the original question, but with a different algebraic expression. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception that the student has only completed one of the two operations, rather than applying both operations correctly.

Let me explain:

* The question text asks about the fraction of a circle that is shaded, and the diagram shows 2 out of 8 equal parts shaded.
* The construct being targeted is "Identify non-unit fractions when part of a shape", which requires the student to identify the correct fraction of the shape that is shaded.
* The correct answer is `\\( \\frac{2}{8} \\)`, which is a non-unit fraction.
* The misconception being targeted is "Denominator used for other parts rather than total parts", which means that some students might incorrectly use the number of shaded parts (2) as the denominator instead of the total number of parts (8).

Here's a breakdown of the question:

* The question text asks the student to identify the correct ratio to use to find the value of x in a right-angled triangle diagram.
* The construct targeted is the ability to identify questions involving a 2D right-angled triangle that require the use of the Tangent (tan) ratio.

* The construct being targeted is the ability to solve one-step linear equations requiring multiplication or division, involving positive decimals.
* The correct answer is x = 0.1, which requires the student to divide both sides of the equation by 0.5.
* The misconception being targeted is the belief that division is commutative, which might lead a student to think that x / 0.5 = 0.2 implies x = 0.2 / 0.5, rather than performing the correct operation.

Misconception 163/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A survey found that 30 out of 50 students in Class A like pizza and 60 out of 100 students in Class B like pizza. Which class is more likely to have a higher proportion of students who like pizza?",

Let me explain the question:

* The question presents a scenario where two classes, A and B, have responded to a survey about liking pizza.
* Class A has 30 out of 50 students who like pizza, while Class B has 60 out of 100 students who like pizza.
* The correct answer is Class A, because it has a higher proportion of students who like pizza (30/50 = 0.6) compared to Class B (60/100 = 0.6).
* The misconception targeted is that students might think that Class B has a higher proportion of students who like pizza simply because it has a larger sample size (100 students vs 50 students in Class A). This misconception ignores the fact that sample size affects reliability and that relative frequencies should be compared to determine which prediction is more likely to be reliable.

Let me explain the question:

The question provides the area of a parallelogram and asks for the height. A student who understands the concept can use the formula for the area of a parallelogram (A = b × h) to calculate the height. The distractors could be:

* 3 cm (calculated by dividing the area by an incorrect base length)
* 12 cm (calculated by dividing the area by the correct base length, but forgetting to consider the unit)
* "Cannot be determined" (reflecting the misconception that there is not enough information)

The correct answer is 6 cm, which is calculated by dividing the area by the base length (36 cm² ÷ 6 cm = 6 cm).

        },
        "misconception": "Believes the solution of a quadratic inequality is always the interval between the roots"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question targets the construct of "Solve quadratic inequalities from the graph of the quadratic". The graph of y = x² + 2x - 3 would have x-intercepts at x = -3 and x = 1.

The correct answer is {x < -3 or x > 1}, which represents the regions where the graph is above the x-axis.

The misconception is that the student might think the solution is simply the interval between the roots, i.e., {x > -3 and x < 1}, which is incorrect.

Let me explain how this example targets the same misconception:

* The question asks students to identify a square number, which requires them to understand what a square number is.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know what a square number is"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is designed to test the student's understanding of square numbers. The correct answer is 16, which is a square number (4^2). The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be numbers that are not square numbers, such as 10, 20, or 22.

The construct "Identify square numbers" represents the specific skill being targeted, and the misconception "Does not know what a square number is" corresponds to the potential misunderstanding that a student may have.

        },
        "misconception": "When finding the nth term of a linear sequence, thinks the first term is the coefficient in front of n."
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks students to find the nth term of a linear sequence given a pattern.
* The construct targets the skill of generating a linear sequence from a pattern.
* The correct answer is "3 + 3n", which represents the nth term of the sequence.
* The misconception corresponds to the incorrect thinking that the first term of the sequence (3) is the coefficient in front of n, which is not the case.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the thought process behind this question:

* The question is targeting the construct "Find missing side lengths in a right-angled triangle", which requires the student to use the Pythagorean theorem.
* The misconception "Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean" suggests that the student may not understand the notation used to indicate the length of a side.
* The distractors (not shown in this format, but could be added) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as answers that incorrectly interpret the dashes as indicating a specific length or ignore them altogether.
* The correct answer, "10cm", requires the student to correctly interpret the dashes and apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side c.

Misconception 214/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the construct "Identify properties of quadrilaterals" and the correct answer is "It is a rectangle". The misconception is the same, "Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean", which is a common misconception that students may have when interpreting diagrams with dashes on the sides of shapes.

Let me explain this example:

* The question text presents three options, but only one is a quadratic sequence. The correct answer is "1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...", which is a quadratic sequence.
* The construct "Recognise quadratic sequences" represents the specific skill being targeted by this question.

Misconception 229/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 7x - 2. What is the first step?",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations with the variable appearing on both sides, with all positive integers",
            "answer": "Subtract 2x from both sides to get 5 = 5x - 2"
        },
        "misconception": "Subtracts the smallest digit from the largest digit"
    }
]
```

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

The misconception is that students might subtract the smallest digit from the largest digit, which is not a valid step in solving linear equations. In this question, the correct answer is to subtract 2x from both sides to get 5 = 5x - 2, but the distractors could include options like "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 7x - 7" or "Subtract 2 from both sides to get 2x + 3 = 7x - 4", which would reflect the misconception of subtracting the smallest digit from the largest digit.

            "construct": "Recognise the vertically opposite angles relationship",
            "answer": "They are equal"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses vertically opposite angles with angles on a straight line"
    }

Misconception 233/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11",
            "construct": "Given a linear equation, solve for x",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up the value of two terms when substituting"
    }
]

In this example, the distractors could be:

* x = 7 (mixing up the value of x and the result of the equation)
* x = 9 (mixing up the value of the constant term and the result of the equation)
* x = 1 (mixing up the value of the coefficient of x and the result of the equation)

The correct answer is x = 3, which is obtained by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 2.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes the solution to mx + c = a is the x intercept of y = mx +c"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is targeting the construct "Given a simple linear equation, solve for x", which requires the student to solve for x in a simple linear equation.

The correct answer is x = 3.

The misconception is the same as in your original example: "Believes the solution to mx + c = a is the x intercept of y = mx +c". This misconception might lead a student to think that the solution is the x-intercept of the graph of y = 2x + 5, rather than actually solving the equation 2x + 5 = 11.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know that we can use the conservation of perimeter to find missing lengths"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question shows a rectangle with two sides labelled 5 cm and 8 cm, and the third side labelled x cm. The student is asked to find the length of the unknown side. The correct answer is "Cannot be determined" because there is not enough information to find the exact value of x.

The construct being tested is the same as in the previous example: "Calculate missing lengths of shapes by geometrical inference, where the lengths given are in the same units". This construct represents the skill of using geometric properties to find missing lengths in shapes.

The misconception being targeted is the same as before: "Does not know that we can use the conservation of perimeter to find missing lengths". This misconception represents the common mistake of assuming that the perimeter of a shape can be used to find a missing side length, when in fact, more information is needed.

        },
        "misconception": "Ignores negative sign when expanding bracket"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

The correct answer is $4x^2 - 9$, which requires the student to expand the expression correctly, taking into account the negative sign in the bracket.

The misconception "Ignores negative sign when expanding bracket" may lead students to answer $4x^2 + 9$ (ignoring the negative sign) or some other incorrect answer.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* $4x^2 + 9$ (ignoring the negative sign)
* $8x - 9$ (incorrect expansion)
* $4x^2 - 18$ (another incorrect expansion)

These distractors are designed to correspond with potential misconceptions or errors that students may make when expanding quadratic expressions, making it a diagnostic question that can help identify areas where students need additional support.

        },
        "misconception": "When finding the differences between terms in a sequence, believes they can do so from right to left"
    }
]

Let me explain the rationale behind this question:

* The sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ... is an ascending exponential sequence, and the correct answer is 48.
* The construct being targeted is "Generate the next term in an ascending exponential sequence", which requires the student to recognize the pattern and apply it to find the next term.
* The misconception being targeted is the same as before: "When finding the differences between terms in a sequence, believes they can do so from right to left". This misconception might cause the student to try to find the difference between the terms starting from the right, rather than recognizing the exponential pattern.

Note that the distractors for this question could include options such as "30", "36", or "40", which might appeal to students who are using the incorrect method of finding differences from right to left.

    }

In this question, the correct answer is x < -3, but a student who holds the misconception may think that dividing both sides by -3 results in x > 3, or x > -9/3, because they fail to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes to complete a part whole model you select a value already given in the model"

In this question, the correct answer is 75%. However, students who hold the misconception might choose 3/4 as the answer because they are selecting a value already given in the model (the fraction 3/4), rather than converting it to a percentage.

Misconception 323/4370:

            "answer": "24"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer"
    }

In this example, the question is designed to target the construct "Carry out multiplication problems involving two negative integers", and the correct answer is 24.

        },
        "misconception": "When reading value from graph, reads from the wrong axes."
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question shows a graph with a linear relationship between x and y. The student is asked to find the value of x when y = 4. The correct answer is x = 3.

The distractors (not shown) would correspond to the misconception, where the student might read the value from the wrong axes, for example, thinking that y = 4 corresponds to x = 4, or x = 2, etc.

The construct "Read values from graph" targets the specific skill of reading values from a graph, and the misconception "When reading value from graph, reads from the wrong axes" highlights a common error that students make when doing so.

        },
        "misconception": "Uses only the first two terms of a sequence to work out a term-to-term rule"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question is asking students to identify the term-to-term rule of a sequence. The correct answer is "Add 4 to the previous term to get the next term".

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* "Multiply the previous term by 2" (using only the first two terms to work out the rule)
* "Add 2 to the previous term to get the next term" (a plausible but incorrect rule)
* "Add 8 to the previous term to get the next term" (another plausible but incorrect rule)

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as before: "Uses only the first two terms of a sequence to work out a term-to-term rule". This misconception is addressed by designing the distractors to tempt students who might fall into this trap, and by having a correct answer that requires considering the entire sequence, not just the first two terms.

Misconception 363/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A car travels 24 kilometres in 4 hours. What is the speed of the car?",
            "construct": "Calculate speed where distance and time are in the appropriate units",
            "answer": "6 km/h"
        },
        "misconception": "Makes an assumption about the squares on a scale representing either 1 or 10"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

The question requires the student to calculate the speed of the car, which involves dividing the distance (24 km) by the time (4 hours). However, the misconception that students may have is that they might assume the scale on the graph paper (not shown in this question, but implied) represents 1 or 10 units, which would lead them to miscalculate the speed.

For example, if a student assumes the scale represents 1 unit, they might divide 24 by 4 to get 6, but with the wrong units (e.g., km/min). Or, if they assume the scale represents 10 units, they might divide 24 by 40 to get 0.6, again with the wrong units (e.g., km/min). The correct answer, of course, is 6 km/h.

This question is designed to elicit this specific misconception, allowing the teacher to identify students who may be struggling with understanding the representation of units on a graph or scale.

Misconception 364/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Calculate velocity from a distance-time graph",
            "answer": "20 m/s"
        },
        "misconception": "Makes an assumption about the squares on a scale representing either 1 or 10"
    }
]

This question shows a distance-time graph with a straight line, and the student is asked to calculate the velocity at a marked point. The correct answer is 20 m/s, but the distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception that the squares on the graph represent either 1 or 10 units, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of velocity.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question targeting the same misconception:

[

            "construct": "Read time from a distance-time graph",
            "answer": "(10,30)"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes scales on graphs must match on both axes"
    }
]

The question is designed to test the student's ability to read a distance-time graph and identify the time corresponding to a certain distance. The distractors would be written to correspond with the misconception that the scales on both axes must match, for example:

* (30,10) (swapping the values)
* (15,60) (assuming the scales are the same on both axes)
* (60,15) (assuming the scales are the same on both axes)

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to simplify a fraction by cancelling common factors, which targets the construct "Simplify fractions by cancelling common factors".
* The correct answer is "3/4", which is the simplified form of the fraction 9/12.
* The misconception "Does not understand how to simplify fractions" corresponds to the distractors, which might include answers such as "1/2" ( simplifying only one factor), "6/8" (not cancelling common factors at all), or "Cannot be simplified" (same misconception as in your original example).

Let me explain this example:

* The question text is asking about the middle value of a dataset, which is a classic median-related question.
* The construct name is "Determine the median of a dataset", which targets the specific skill of finding the median.
* The correct answer is "6", which is the middle value of the dataset when arranged in order.

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The construct "Factorise a quadratic expression in the form x² - c" is targeted, which is a specific skill that students should possess.
* The question text "x^2 - 9" is a quadratic expression in the form x² - c, which allows us to assess the student's ability to factorise such expressions.
* The correct answer is "$(x-3)(x+3)$", which is the correct factorisation of the expression.
* The misconception "Believes only the first term needs to be divided when factorising an expression" is a common mistake that students might make. For example, they might think the answer is "x(x-9)" because they only divided the first term x² by x. This misconception is addressed by the correct answer, which shows that both terms need to be divided correctly.

Let me explain this example:

* The question text presents a scenario where a triangle needs to be reflected in a horizontal line.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to reflect a polygon (in this case, a triangle) in a horizontal line, where the line of reflection lies on the edge or outside the object.
* The correct answer is that the image of the triangle should be positioned below the line of reflection, at the same distance as the original triangle.
* The misconception being targeted is that students may fail to reflect the triangle across the mirror line, instead drawing the image in the same location or at an incorrect distance from the line of reflection.

A) ![An image of a grid with a triangle drawn in the upper half, a blue line across the middle and a triangle drawn immediately below, rotated 90 degrees. ]()
B) ![An image of a grid with a triangle drawn in the upper half, a blue line across the middle and a triangle drawn two lines down from the blue line, unchanged. ]()
C) ![An image of a grid with a triangle drawn in the upper half, a blue line across the middle and a triangle drawn one line down from the blue line, reflected correctly. ]()

In this example, the question is asking for the average score of a set of exam results, and the correct answer is 6. The construct being targeted is "Calculate the mean as an average from a list of data". The misconception being addressed is that some students might give the mode (i.e. the most frequent score) as the answer, rather than calculating the mean.

Let me explain this question:

* The question asks students to identify which equation represents a horizontal line.
* The construct "Distinguish between horizontal and vertical lines" targets the specific skill of understanding the difference between these two types of lines.
* The correct answer is "y = 4", which is a horizontal line.
* The misconception "Confuses the equations of vertical and horizontal lines" corresponds to the idea that students might mistakenly think that an equation like "x = 4" represents a horizontal line, when in fact it represents a vertical line.

Let me explain the question and the distractors:

* The correct answer is a graph with a horizontal asymptote in the positive region of the y-axis, which represents the inverse relationship between the distance from a mirror and the magnification of a mirror.
* The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) might include:
	+ A linear graph with a positive gradient (distractor 1): This might appeal to students who think that the magnification increases linearly with distance from the mirror.
	+ A parabolic graph (distractor 2): This might appeal to students who think that the magnification follows a quadratic relationship with distance from the mirror.
	+ A straight line graph (distractor 3): This corresponds to the misconception that a reciprocal graph can be a straight line.

The construct is "Identify the graph that represents the inverse relationship between variables", which is a specific skill that the question is targeting.

```

In this example, the correct answer is 66, which is the difference between the largest value (89) and the smallest value (23). The misconception is that the student might choose 89 as the answer, thinking that the range is simply the largest value in the set.

        },
        "misconception": "Confuses the lines y=x and y=-x"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the construct "Describe the solution to a graphical equality involving a single diagonal line", and the correct answer is "y = x". The distractors would be designed to correspond to the misconception "Confuses the lines y=x and y=-x", such as "y = -x", "x = y", or other incorrect options that might be chosen by a student who holds this misconception.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes order of operations does not affect the answer to a calculation"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question is designed. The construct "Follow the order of operations when evaluating expressions" is the specific skill we want to assess. The correct answer is indeed 10, which is obtained by following the order of operations (first multiply 2 and 3, then add 4).

The distractors (not shown here, but would be included in a full question) would be designed to correspond to the misconception "Believes order of operations does not affect the answer to a calculation". For example, one distractor might be "14" (obtained by adding 2 and 3, then multiplying by 4), and another might be "12" (obtained by performing the operations in a different order).

By using a multiple-choice format with carefully crafted distractors, we can diagnose whether students hold this misconception or not.

            "construct": "Given an equation of the form mx + c = a, solve for x",
            "answer": "x = 1"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes the solution to mx + c = a is the x intercept of y = mx + c"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking the student to solve a simple linear equation, 2x + 3 = 5. The correct approach is to subtract 3 from both sides and then divide by 2, resulting in x = 1.

The construct being targeted is the ability to solve an equation of the form mx + c = a for x.

The misconception being addressed is that some students might think that the solution to the equation is the x-intercept of the graph of y = mx + c, which is not necessarily the case. In this example, the x-intercept of the graph of y = 2x + 3 is x = -1.5, but that's not the solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 5.

Misconception 543/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following statements is true about the inequality -3 > -5?",
            "construct": "Use inequality notation to compare two negative integers",
            "answer": "-3 is not greater than -5"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand inequality notation"
    }
]

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The question text is designed to test the student's ability to understand inequality notation when comparing two negative integers.
* The construct name is specific and granular, highlighting the exact skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "-3 is not greater than -5", which requires the student to correctly interpret the inequality notation.
* The misconception is the same as before, "Does not understand inequality notation", which is the potential mistake that the student might make if they struggle with this question.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) would be designed to correspond with this misconception, such as:

* "-3 is greater than -5" (misunderstanding the direction of the inequality)
* "-5 is greater than -3" (confusing the order of the numbers)
* "The inequality is always true" (lacking understanding of how to evaluate the inequality)

These distractors would be designed to be plausible incorrect answers that a student might choose if they hold the misconception.

Misconception 568/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the volume of the rectangular prism with dimensions 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm?",
            "construct": "Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism when all dimensions are given in the same units",
            "answer": "60 cm³"
        },
        "misconception": "Adds when calculating volume instead of multiplying"
    }
]
```

This question tests the student's ability to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, which requires multiplying the dimensions together. The misconception is that the student might add the dimensions instead of multiplying them, leading to an incorrect answer.

    },
    "misconception": "Believes multiplying a positive by a negative gives a positive answer"

Misconception 571/4370:
Here is another example:

    {
        "question": {
            "text": "\( \left(\begin{array}{l}4 \\ 1\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 3\end{array}\right)= \)",
            "construct": "Add column vectors each containing two elements",
            "answer": "\( \left(\begin{array}{c}6 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \)"
        },
        "misconception": "When adding column vectors, multiplies rather than adds"
    }
]

Misconception 572/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following graphs could represent a quadratic function?",
            "construct": "Recognise a quadratic graph from its shape",
            "answer": "Only graph A"
        },
        "misconception": "Only recognises the positive form of a quadratic graph"
    }
]

Note: Graph A would be a positive parabola (U shape), and the other options (B, C, D) would be graphs that are not quadratic functions, such as a linear graph, a cubic graph, or a graph with a different shape. The misconception is that the student only recognizes the positive form of a quadratic graph, and does not consider the possibility of a negative quadratic graph (upside-down U shape).

Misconception 573/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following graphs could represent the equation y = x^2?",
            "construct": "Recognise a quadratic graph from its shape",
            "answer": "Only option C"
        },
        "misconception": "Only recognises the negative form of a quadratic graph"
    }
]

Note: The options for this question would be:
A) A linear graph with a positive slope
B) A cubic graph with a positive leading coefficient
C) A quadratic graph with a positive leading coefficient (a U-shaped graph)
D) A quadratic graph with a negative leading coefficient (an upside-down U-shaped graph)

Misconception 574/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the shape of the graph of a quadratic function?",
            "construct": "Recognise a quadratic graph from its shape",
            "answer": "It can be any shape"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise a quadratic graph"
    }
]

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

The question is designed to target the same construct "Recognise a quadratic graph from its shape" as the original example. The correct answer is "It can be any shape" because quadratic graphs can open upwards or downwards, and can have different orientations.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* "It's always a straight line" (misconception: thinks quadratic graphs are linear)
* "It's always a circle" (misconception: thinks quadratic graphs are circular)
* "It's always an L-shape" (misconception: thinks quadratic graphs have a specific, non-parabolic shape)

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as the original: "Does not recognise a quadratic graph". This misconception represents the idea that the student doesn't have a clear understanding of what a quadratic graph looks like, and may confuse it with other shapes or types of graphs.

Misconception 575/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "The area of this trapezium is 30 cm². What is the value of x?",
            "construct": "Given the area of a trapezium, calculate a missing dimension",
            "answer": "5 cm"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not divide by 2 when calculating the area of a trapezium"
    }
]

Here is the corresponding diagram:
![A trapezium with the parallel sides labelled with 3cm and x and the height labelled with 4cm](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/3/a/a3a75abad4a8eebacd0ead9daa2d65b8b4f6eb46.png)

Misconception 576/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the value of √(-25)?",
            "construct": "Calculate the square root of a number",
            "answer": "It cannot be determined"
        },
        "misconception": "Can not square root a negative number"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks about the square root of a negative number (-25).
* The correct answer is "It cannot be determined" because the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number, which cannot be expressed as a real number.
* The construct targeted by this question is still "Calculate the square root of a number".
* The misconception being targeted is the same one: "Can not square root a negative number", which means the student may think that it's not possible to find the square root of a negative number, which is incorrect.

Misconception 577/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same Misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the value of x in the equation x^2 = -9?",
            "construct": "Solve quadratics with negative coefficients",
            "answer": "No real solution"
        },
        "misconception": "Can not square root a negative number"
    }
]

Let me explain what's happening here:

* The question text asks the student to solve a quadratic equation with a negative coefficient, which requires an understanding of complex numbers or the recognition that no real solution exists.
* The correct answer is "No real solution", which targets the construct "Solve quadratics with negative coefficients".
* The misconception "Can not square root a negative number" is the incorrect thinking that might lead a student to struggle with this question. Students holding this misconception might think it's impossible to square root a negative number, and therefore, might not know how to approach the problem or might provide an incorrect solution.

Misconception 578/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Tom wants to buy some toys. Each toy costs £2.50. Tom has £8 to spend. What is the greatest number of toys he can buy?",
            "construct": "Multiply amounts of money up to £10",
            "answer": "3"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes you can go above an amount of money when finding how much of something you can buy"
    }
]

Misconception 579/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = x + 11",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations with variables on both sides",
            "answer": "x = 6"
        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question requires the student to solve a linear equation with variables on both sides.
* The correct approach involves subtracting x from both sides and then subtracting 5 from both sides to isolate x.
* A student with the misconception may try to add x to both sides (instead of subtracting x) or add 5 to both sides (instead of subtracting 5), leading to an incorrect solution.

The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect these common errors, making it easier to identify students who hold this misconception.

Misconception 580/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations in one variable",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception. The correct approach to solve this equation is to subtract 5 from both sides, and then divide both sides by 2. However, a student who holds the misconception might add 5 to both sides (using the same operation) and then divide by 2, leading to an incorrect solution.

Misconception 581/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x: 2x - 3 > 5 - x",
            "construct": "Solve linear inequalities in one variable where the unknown appears on both sides of the equation",
            "answer": "x > 4"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes they can multiply/divide through by a negative number without changing the direction of the inequality"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is x > 4, but the distractors would be designed to appeal to students who believe they can multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by a negative number without changing the direction of the inequality.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes the difference between triangle numbers remains the same"
    }
]

In this example, the construct "Identify a triangle number" targets the student's ability to recognize a triangle number. The correct answer is 210, which is a triangle number. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to appeal to the misconception that the difference between triangle numbers remains the same, for example, by offering options that are not triangle numbers but have a consistent difference from 210.

Let me explain what's going on here:

* The question is asking students to identify a quadratic function from its algebraic representation.
* The construct being targeted is "Recognise an algebraic representation of a quadratic function", which is a specific skill or piece of knowledge.
* The correct answer is y = x^2 + 2x + 1, which is a quadratic function.
* The misconception being addressed is "Does not recognise a quadratic graph", which is a common mistake students might make. In this case, the student might not be able to identify the algebraic representation of a quadratic function, even if they can recognise a quadratic graph visually.

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is designed to test the student's ability to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) when evaluating an expression. The correct answer is 14, which requires the student to follow the correct order of operations: first multiply 3 and 4, then add 2.

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as the one you provided: "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order". In this case, the student might mistakenly evaluate the expression as 2 + 3 = 5, then multiply 5 by 4, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Misconception 620/4370:

            "answer": "Neither of them"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not correctly apply the commutative property of multiplication"
    }
]

Note: The question text is "Which of the following equations is true for mental multiplication?" and the options are:

* 12 × 3 = 3 × 12 + 3
* 12 × 3 = 12 × 3 × 1
* Neither of them

Misconception 621/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the result of calculating 24 × 17 using mental multiplication?",
            "construct": "Recognise and use efficient methods for mental multiplication",
            "answer": "408"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not correctly apply the distributive property of multiplication"
    }
]

In this example, the distractors would be:

* 24 × 17 = (24 × 10) + 17 ( incorrect, as it doesn't apply the distributive property correctly)
* 24 × 17 = (24 × 17) + 1 (incorrect, as it doesn't make sense in the context of mental multiplication)
* 24 × 17 = (24 × 10) + (24 × 7) ( incorrect, as it's a partial application of the distributive property, but not the correct one)

The correct answer is 408, which can be obtained by applying the distributive property correctly, such as (24 × 10) + (24 × 7) = 240 + 168 = 408.

        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks students to solve a simple inequality, which requires adding or subtracting the same value to both sides.
* The correct answer is `{x > 3}`, which represents the solution to the inequality.
* The construct name "Solve simple inequalities by adding or subtracting the same value to both sides" represents the specific skill or knowledge being targeted.
* The misconception "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols" suggests that students may incorrectly swap the direction of the inequality symbol, leading to an incorrect solution.

Let me explain:

* The question text presents multiple options, and the student is asked to identify a prism.
* The construct "Identify a prism from multiple options" targets the specific skill of recognizing a prism from a set of options.
* The correct answer is "A rectangular solid with square bases and rectangular sides", which is a description of a prism.
* The misconception "Does not know the definition of a prism" corresponds to students who may not be familiar with the definition of a prism and therefore may choose an incorrect option.

This question tests the same construct and targets the same misconception as the original example. The question text shows a diagram of a straight line with an angle x, and the student is asked to find the value of x. The correct answer is 180°, but the distractors would be designed to correspond with the misconception that angles on a straight line add to 360 degrees.

        "misconception": "Thinks terms in linear sequence are in direct proportion"
    }
]

In this example, the question presents a scenario where a snail climbs up a well, but slips back each night. The student is asked to predict how many days it will take for the snail to reach the top of the well. The correct answer is 18, which requires the student to recognize the linear sequence and make a prediction about a term in the sequence other than the next one. The misconception being targeted is that students may think that the terms in the linear sequence are in direct proportion, which would lead them to an incorrect answer.

        "misconception": "Believes division is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks students to divide an integer by a mixed number fraction, which targets the construct "Divide an integer by a mixed number fraction".
* The correct answer is 2.
* The misconception targeted by this question is the same as before: "Believes division is commutative". This misconception may lead students to think that the order of the numbers in the division problem doesn't matter, and therefore, they might incorrectly calculate the result.

            "answer": "seconds"
        },
        "misconception": "Mistakes unit of speed for unit of time"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks students to identify a unit of time.
* The construct "Identify a unit of time" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "seconds", which is a unit of time.
* The misconception "Mistakes unit of speed for unit of time" corresponds to the distractors, which could be options like "km/h" or "m/s". These options are incorrect because they are units of speed, not time.

Misconception 688/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[

            "answer": "Minutes"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise a unit of time"
    }
]

In this example, the distractors (not shown) could be:

* Grams (a unit of mass)
* Celsius (a unit of temperature)
* Meters (a unit of length)

Each of these distractors corresponds to a potential misconception that a student may have, which is that they do not recognize a unit of time.

            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes subtraction is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain what's going on here:

* The question text asks students to solve a simple linear equation.
* The construct "Solve linear equations involving subtraction" targets the specific skill of subtracting a value from both sides of an equation to isolate the variable.
* The correct answer is x = 3, which is obtained by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.
* The misconception "Believes subtraction is commutative" suggests that some students might think that subtracting 5 from both sides is equivalent to subtracting 11 from both sides (i.e., switching the order of the subtraction), which would lead to an incorrect solution.

Misconception 698/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A bar model is used to represent the equation 2x = 8. Which of the following bar models represents the equation?",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra"
    }
]

Let me explain the question and distractors:

* The correct answer is "Two bars of equal length, one labelled 2x and the other labelled 8", which represents the equation 2x = 8 using a bar model.
* Distractor 1: "A single bar divided into 2 parts, one labelled x and the other labelled 8" (misconceives the equation as a single quantity being divided into parts)
* Distractor 2: "A bar of length 2, with 8 smaller bars of length x" (misconceives the equation as a quantity being multiplied rather than equated)
* Distractor 3: "A bar of length 8, with 2 smaller bars of length x" (misconceives the equation as a quantity being divided rather than equated)

These distractors are designed to tap into the misconception of not understanding bar modelling in algebra, specifically in representing equations.

Misconception 699/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following bar models represents the equation 3x = 12?",
            "construct": "Represent an equation using a bar model",
            "answer": "None of the above"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra"
    }
]

Note: The correct answer is "None of the above" because the options provided do not accurately represent the equation 3x = 12.

Here are the distractors (incorrect options):

A) 
```
|x| |x| |x|
```

B) 
```
|3| |4|
```

C) 
```
|x| |x| |x| |x|
```

Each distractor is designed to correspond with a potential misconception related to bar modelling in algebra, such as misunderstanding the representation of variables, constants, or the relationship between the two.

Misconception 700/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

            "answer": "Neither A, B nor C"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra"
    }
]

Here's the breakdown:

* Question text: The question asks students to choose the correct bar model representation of the equation 2x + 3.
* Construct: The construct targeted is still "Represent an equation using a bar model".
* Answer: The correct answer is "Neither A, B nor C", implying that the student should be able to recognize that none of the options accurately represent the equation using a bar model.
* Misconception: The misconception remains the same, "Does not understand bar modelling in algebra", as the question is designed to diagnose students' understanding of bar models in algebra.

        },
        "misconception": "When subtracting a negative number, subtracts the absolute value rather than adding it"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the construct of solving linear equations involving addition and subtraction, and the correct answer is 3. The misconception is the same as before, where the student might subtract the absolute value of the negative number instead of adding it, leading to an incorrect solution.

In this example, the question is targeting the construct "Use a bar model to represent multiplication", but the misconception is still related to not knowing how to use a bar model to write division facts. The incorrect options (distractors) could be things like "The answer is 5 because there are 5 shelves" or "The answer is 8 because each shelf can hold 8 boxes", which would indicate that the student is not using the bar model correctly to represent multiplication.

Misconception 718/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following values is NOT a multiple of 3?",
            "construct": "Identify patterns in multiple tables",

        },
        "misconception": "Believes an outlier is a value that does not fit the same characteristics as the other values"
    }
]

Here's the breakdown:

* The question asks students to identify which value is not a multiple of 3, and the correct answer is 10.
* The construct being targeted is "Identify patterns in multiple tables", which refers to the student's ability to recognize patterns in multiples of a given number.
* The misconception being addressed is the same as before: "Believes an outlier is a value that does not fit the same characteristics as the other values". In this case, the student may mistakenly choose one of the other options (e.g. 9, 12, 15) because they don't fit the pattern of being a multiple of 3, rather than recognizing that 10 is the one that doesn't fit the pattern.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes nth term rules for patterns must be given in standard an + b form"
    }
]
```

Here's the explanation:

* The question is asking students to identify the correct expression for the nth term of a pattern.
* The construct is still "Use a linear sequence expressed as a pattern to make a prediction about another term in the sequence other than the next one", which is the same as the previous example.
* The answer is "2n + 1", which is the correct expression for the nth term of the pattern.
* The misconception is still "Believes nth term rules for patterns must be given in standard an + b form", which is the same as the previous example. This misconception is being targeted because students may think that the correct answer must be in the form of "an + b" (e.g. 2n + 3), but in reality, the correct answer can be in a different form (e.g. 2n + 1).

The pattern shown below is:

        },
        "misconception": "Believes nth term rules for patterns must be given in standard an + b form"

]

This question targets the same misconception as the original example, which is that students may believe that nth term rules for patterns must be given in standard an + b form. The distractors are designed to appeal to this misconception, and the correct answer is intended to help students understand that the equation 20 × 2 + 3 is not a correct representation of the pattern.

In this example, the correct answer is $a^6$ because $(a^2)^3 = a^{2\times 3} = a^6$. A student who chooses a different answer, such as $a^{2\times 3}$ or $a^8$, may be demonstrating the misconception that they multiply the index (in this case, 2) by the power (in this case, 3) instead of raising the base to the power of the product of the indices.

]
```

In this example, the question targets the construct "Understand the concept of remainders in division", and the incorrect answers (distractors) are designed to reflect the misconception "Does not understand remainders in division". For instance, a student who does not understand remainders in division might think that the answer is simply 48 ÷ 12 = 4, without considering the remainder.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand how to maintain equivalence in fractions"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking students to identify an equivalent expression to the given algebraic fraction. The distractors (not shown here) would be designed to reflect common misconceptions, such as multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator by the same value, or simplifying the fraction in an incorrect way.

The construct being targeted is the specific skill of simplifying algebraic fractions where the denominator is a linear expression.

The misconception being targeted is the same as before: "Does not understand how to maintain equivalence in fractions". This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as incorrectly applying operations to the numerator and denominator, or not recognizing when an equivalent expression is not actually equivalent.

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to evaluate the expression 2 × 3 + 10 - 5.
* The construct being targeted is "Apply the order of operations to evaluate expressions", which requires students to follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS).
* The correct answer is 11, which can be obtained by following the correct order of operations: 2 × 3 = 6, then 6 + 10 = 16, and finally 16 - 5 = 11.
* The misconception being targeted is the same as before: "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order". This means that students who hold this misconception might try to evaluate the expression from left to right, getting an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Converts a fraction to a decimal by using the denominator after the decimal point"
    }
]

Here's how I came up with this example:

* I wanted to create a question that still targets the construct of representing fractions on a probability scale.
* I chose a different context (picking a king from a deck of cards) to make the question distinct from the original example.
* I wrote the question text to lead the student to calculate the probability, which is a fraction (4/52).
* I created answer choices, one of which is the correct answer (B) and the others are distractors. The correct answer might be, for example, "4/52" or "0.08" (if the student is able to simplify the fraction).
* The misconception remains the same, as it is a common mistake that students might make when converting fractions to decimals. In this case, the student might incorrectly write the probability as "5200."

In this question, the correct answer is that the image of the triangle will be on the other side of the vertical line, because the triangle is reflected across the line.

* The question asks about the measure of a specific angle, testing the student's ability to identify an obtuse angle.
* The construct "Identify obtuse angles" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is 135°, which is an obtuse angle between 90° and 180°.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

[
    {

            "construct": "Apply the inverse operation to both sides of an equation",

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks two variables next to each other represent addition"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

The correct solution to the equation 2x + 5 = 11 involves subtracting 5 from both sides, then dividing both sides by 2. However, a student who thinks that two variables next to each other represent addition might try to "add" 2 and x together, or try to "add" 5 to both sides of the equation, leading to an incorrect solution.

By providing a simple linear equation with a clear correct solution, this question is designed to elicit the misconception that two variables next to each other represent addition, while still being answerable by a student who understands the correct procedure for solving equations.

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks two variables next to each other represent addition"
    }
]
```

In this example, the student is expected to solve for x in a simple linear equation. The correct answer is x = 3, but the distractor is designed to appeal to the misconception that two variables next to each other represent addition, leading the student to think that 2x + 5 means "add 2 and x, then add 5".

Here's the explanation:

The question shows a number line from 150 to 180, with an arrow pointing to a value between 160 and 170. The correct answer is 165, which is exactly halfway between 160 and 170.

The construct is the same as before, as it targets the specific skill of reading an integer on a scale where the required measurement is marked by a dash between two numbers.

The misconception is also the same, as it corresponds to the idea that students may incorrectly assume that each dash on the number line represents an increment of 10, rather than understanding that the dashes are equally spaced between the labeled numbers on the number line.

Here's a brief explanation:

* The question asks about the relationship between two lines, A and B, which are shown to be intersecting (but not necessarily perpendicular).
* The construct being targeted is "Identify perpendicular lines", which is a specific skill or knowledge component.
* The correct answer is "Intersecting", as the lines do intersect, but not necessarily at a 90-degree angle.

Here's the question:

What is the median of the following numbers?
\[
3,1,5,7,9,4
\]

This question is designed to test whether the student has the misconception that you don't need to numerically order the data before calculating the median. The correct answer is 5, but a student with this misconception might choose a different answer, such as 7, because they didn't take the time to order the data first.

Let me explain how I designed this question:

* The question text presents a simple expression that requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
* The construct "Apply order of operations to evaluate expressions" targets a specific skill that is relevant to the question.
* The correct answer is 11, which can be obtained by following the correct order of operations: 2 × 3 = 6, then add 10 = 16, then subtract 5 = 11.
* The misconception "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" is the incorrect thinking that might lead a student to perform the operations in the wrong order, for example, multiplying 2 and 3, then adding 10, then subtracting 5, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

In this example, the correct answer is 3, which is obtained by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 2. The misconceptions corresponding to the distractors might be:

* Adding 5 to both sides instead of subtracting 5 (same operation rather than the inverse)
* Subtracting 2 from both sides instead of dividing by 2 (same operation rather than the inverse)
* Dividing both sides by 5 instead of subtracting 5 (same operation rather than the inverse)

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to identify a regular polygon among options.
* The construct targets the specific skill of understanding the terms "equilateral" and "regular" and recognizing the notation for regular polygons.
* The correct answer is "A hexagon with all sides of equal length", as a regular polygon is a polygon with equal sides and equal angles.
* The misconception identified is that students may not know the meaning of the word "regular", which could lead them to choose incorrect options.

```

Here's a brief explanation:

* The question text asks about the value of `h` in the formula for the area of a trapezium.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to calculate the area of a trapezium when the dimensions are given in the same units.
* The correct answer is `5`, which is the perpendicular height of the trapezium.
* The misconception being targeted is that students might use the slant height (instead of the perpendicular height) to find the area of the trapezium.

    {

        },
        "misconception": "Fails to reflect across mirror line"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question shows a triangle reflected in a vertical line. The student is asked what is true about the reflection. The correct answer is that the reflected triangle is on the other side of the vertical line.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* The reflected triangle is identical to the original triangle.
* The reflected triangle is rotated 90 degrees.
* The reflected triangle is in the same position as the original triangle.

These distractors correspond to the misconception "Fails to reflect across mirror line", as students may not understand that the reflection should be on the other side of the vertical line.

Misconception 887/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {

            "answer": "A'"
        },
        "misconception": "Fails to reflect across mirror line"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question asks students to identify the image of point A after reflection in the given line of reflection. The construct is the same as in the previous example, and the misconception is also the same, as students may fail to reflect point A across the mirror line. The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) would be designed to correspond with this misconception, for example, by placing the image of point A on the same side of the line of reflection as the original point A, rather than on the opposite side.

]

In this example, the correct answer is obtained by following the order of operations (PEMDAS), which dictates that subtraction should be evaluated from left to right. However, a student who believes that subtraction is commutative may think that 3 - 2x + 5 = 3 + 5 - 2x, leading them to a incorrect answer.

Let me explain:

**Question Text:** "What is the value of x in the equation 2x = -12?"

**Construct:** "Solve linear equations involving negative numbers"

**Answer:** "x = -6"

**Misconception:** "Believes multiplying a positive by a negative gives a positive answer"

In this example, the distractors could be:

* x = 6 (due to the misconception that multiplying a positive by a negative gives a positive answer)
* x = -12 (confusing the variable x with the constant term -12)
* x = 2 (confusing the coefficient of x with the value of x)

These distractors target specific misconceptions that students may have when solving linear equations involving negative numbers.

Note: The graph for this question could be a line graph with distance on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, with points plotted to show the distance traveled at different times. The correct answer would be the y-value at x=2.5 hours, and the distractors could be designed to reflect a misreading of the scale (e.g. incorrectly reading the y-axis labels or miscounting the units).

In this example, the correct answer is 25, which is obtained by following the order of operations (PEMDAS) and evaluating the expression inside the brackets first. The distractors would be designed to appeal to the misconception, such as:

* 2+3² (due to ignoring the brackets and performing the exponentiation first)

    }
]

Let me explain what's going on in this question:

* The question text asks the student to simplify the fraction 15/24.
* The correct answer is 5/8, which requires factoring out the greatest common divisor of 15 and 24 (which is 3).
* The misconception targets students who might try to simplify the fraction by adding or subtracting the same amount from the numerator and denominator, e.g. adding 3 to both numbers to get 18/27, or subtracting 3 from both numbers to get 12/21. This misconception is a common error that students make when simplifying fractions.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount"
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is "2n - 1", which represents a linear sequence. The distractors (not shown) would be formulas that do not represent linear sequences, such as "n^2 + 1" or "3n/2", and are designed to correspond with the misconception that a linear sequence can increase or decrease by varying amounts.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by the same amount"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question is asking students to identify which of the options represents a linear sequence. The correct answer is "2n + 1", which is a linear sequence because it increases by 2 each time.

The construct being targeted is the ability to generate a nth term rule for a linear sequence.

The misconception is the same as the one you provided, which is that students may not recognize that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by the same amount. They may think that a sequence can be linear even if it doesn't follow this rule. The distractors (not shown in this JSON format) would be designed to reflect this misconception.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes linear sequences cannot include fractions"
    }
]

In this example, the question is testing the student's ability to generate a linear sequence from the nth term rule. The correct answer is "2n/2 + 1", which is a linear sequence that includes fractions. The distractors (not shown) would be other options that are not linear sequences or do not include fractions, such as "n^2" or "2n".

In this example, the correct answer is 40, which is obtained by multiplying the number of shelves (5) by the number of books each shelf can hold (8). The misconception targeted is "Does not understand the effect of consecutive operations", as students who struggle with this concept may have difficulty applying the multiplication operation correctly.

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks students to evaluate an expression involving the multiplication of two numbers with different bases (2 and 3).
* The construct targeted is the same as before, which is the multiplication law of indices with positive integer powers and a different base number.
* The correct answer is simply the original expression, as the question is asking for the value of the expression, which requires applying the multiplication law of indices correctly.
* The misconception targeted is the same as before, which is that students might think that when multiplying numbers with different bases, they should multiply the powers and multiply the base numbers, leading to an incorrect result.

In this example, the question targets the construct of "Multiplication law of indices with positive integer powers and the same base number". The correct answer is \(2^{8}\), but the distractors (not shown) might include options like \(2^{15}\) or \(4^{3} \times 4^{5}\), which reflect the misconception that multiplication cannot be broken down into factors.

In this example, the question is designed to test the student's ability to write the next term of an ascending integer linear sequence. The correct answer is 14, which is the next term in the sequence. The misconception targeted is the same as before: students may focus on identifying the term-to-term rule (in this case, adding 3 each time) rather than simply writing the next term in the sequence.

        "misconception": "Thinks the movement of the top number in a column vector is vertical, and the bottom number is horizontal rather than the other way round"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question is asking about a translation vector with negative values, specifically the x-coordinate in this case. The correct answer is `(3, -2)`, but the distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception that the top number in a column vector is vertical and the bottom number is horizontal.

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The correct answer requires the student to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, resulting in n = 3/4 - 2, which equals 1/4.
* The misconception corresponds to a distractor that would result if the student adds 2 to the numerator, resulting in an incorrect answer of 5/4.

        },
        "misconception": "Adds instead of multiplies"

In this example, the correct answer is obtained by multiplying the length and width of the garden, but a student who holds the misconception "Adds instead of multiplies" might calculate the area by adding 6m and 4m, resulting in an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand how to simplify fractions"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question asks the student to simplify the fraction 12/20. The correct answer is 3/5, which targets the construct "Simplify fractions that simplify to a non-unit fraction". This question is designed to diagnose the misconception "Does not understand how to simplify fractions". The distractors (not shown here) would be designed to correspond with this misconception, for example, a student might think the answer is 6/10 or 12/20 itself, showing that they don't understand how to simplify fractions.

        "misconception": "Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling"

In this example, the correct answer is 9, which is the result of squaring 3 (3^2 = 3 × 3 = 9). The misconception targets students who might mistakenly calculate 3^2 as 3 × 2 = 6 or 3 + 2 = 5, which are the distractors.

        "misconception": "Believes gradient at a point = y coordinate/x coordinate"
    }
]
```

Here's the explanation:

The question text asks the student to estimate the gradient of the curve at point P on the graph. The correct answer is 4, which requires the student to understand how to estimate the gradient at a point on a non-linear section of a graph.

The misconception targeted by this question is that the student might believe the gradient at a point is simply the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, which is not the case for non-linear graphs.

        },
        "misconception": "Has multiplied by the root power"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

The correct answer is 3, because 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. However, if a student has the misconception that they need to multiply by the root power, they might choose a distractor answer, such as 27 (multiplying 3 by the cube root power of 3). This question is designed to diagnose whether the student has this specific misconception.

        "misconception": "Believes that adding a negative will increase the value of the original number"

]
```

Let me explain the question:

The question asks students to add two negative integers, and the correct answer is -11. The distractors for this question could be:

* -1 (students who believe adding a negative will increase the value of the original number might choose this answer)
* -5 (students who have a general misunderstanding of addition with negative numbers might choose this answer)
* 11 (students who think that two negative numbers will result in a positive number might choose this answer)

The construct being targeted is "Carry out addition problems involving two negative integers", and the misconception is that students believe adding a negative will increase the value of the original number.

* The question is designed to test the student's ability to expand two brackets with linear terms, which is the same construct as the previous example.
* The correct answer is x = -4, which requires the student to correctly expand the brackets and simplify the equation.
* The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Believes multiplying a positive by a negative gives a positive answer". In this case, the student may mistakenly think that (x + 3)(x - 2) = x^2 + 6x - 6, which would lead them to a different answer.

* The question text is asking students to evaluate an expression with a power (2x^3 = 16), which requires applying the correct order of operations (PEMDAS).
* The construct name "Evaluate expressions with powers" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is x = 2, which students should arrive at by correctly applying the power (x^3) before multiplying by 2.
* The misconception "Multiplies before applying a power" corresponds to a common error students might make, where they would multiply 2 by x before applying the power of 3, leading to an incorrect solution.

]

Let me explain:

* The question asks the student to identify an arithmetic sequence from the options.
* The construct is "Recognise an arithmetic sequence", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "3, 5, 7, 11, 13", which is an arithmetic sequence because each term increases by 2, 2, 4, 2, ... (a constant difference).
* The misconception is the same as before, "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount", which is the potential mistake students might make when answering this question.

        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount"
    }
]

In this question, the correct answer is "2, 4, 6, 8, 10", as it is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception, such as a sequence that increases or decreases by varying amounts (e.g. 2, 5, 10, 17, 26).

B) 3, 6, 9, 18, 36, ...
C) 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, ...
D) None of the above

The correct answer is D) None of the above, because none of the options represent an arithmetic sequence where the terms increase or decrease by the same amount.

]

Let me explain how this question is designed:

* The question text asks the student to identify the fraction of the circle that is shaded.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to read a fraction of a circle when the total number of parts is not given.
* The correct answer is 1/4, which assumes the circle is divided into 4 equal parts.
* The misconception being targeted is that the student might not realise that equivalent fractions can be used to break fractions up into smaller divisions, which might lead them to incorrectly assume the circle is divided into a different number of parts.

Note that the distractors (incorrect options) for this question would be designed to reflect common misconceptions, such as 1/2, 1/3, or 3/4, which might be chosen by students who misunderstand how to read fractions of a circle.

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks a horizontal line on a distance time graph means a distance of 0"
    }
]
```

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks the student to read the distance from home at 11:00 from a displacement-time graph.
* The construct being targeted is "Read values off a displacement-time graph".
* The correct answer is 7.5 km, which is the value on the y-axis corresponding to the time 11:00 on the x-axis.
* The misconception being targeted is the same as before: the student might think that the horizontal line on the graph means a distance of 0, rather than recognizing that the distance is constant at 7.5 km during that time period.

Misconception 1091/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {

```

Here's the graph that accompanies the question:

A line graph with title "A graph to show the velocity of an object on a given day."
The x-axis is titled "Time" and is labelled with times from 0900 to 1200 in steps of 15 minutes, with the axis going 15 minutes beyond 1200.
The y-axis is titled "Velocity (km/h)" and the scale is from 0 to 25 in steps of 5 km/h. The following points are plotted and joined together: (0930, 0), (1000, 10), (1030, 12), (1100, 15), (1130, 18), (1200, 20).

            "construct": "Evaluate exponential expressions",
            "answer": "2^x"

        "misconception": "Believes a number raised to a power will always give a positive answer"
    }

Misconception 1094/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[

            "construct": "Solve quadratic equations using factoring",

        },
        "misconception": "Believes 0 is not a real solution to an equation"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question tests the student's ability to recognize that the quadratic equation x^2 + 4 = 0 has no real solutions. The correct answer is "No real solution". The misconception targeted is the same as before, that 0 is not considered a real solution to an equation. The distractors would be other options that might tempt students who hold this misconception, such as "x = 2" or "x = -2".

            "construct": "Identify parallel lines written in the form y = mx + c",

        },
        "misconception": "Believes lines can be parallel by having the same y intercept OR gradient"
    }
]

Here's how the question and distractors are designed:

* The correct answer is "None of the above" because the options are:
	+ A) y = x + 2 and y = x + 3 (same slope, different y-intercept, so not parallel)
	+ B) y = 2x + 1 and y = 3x + 1 (same y-intercept, different slope, so not parallel)
	+ C) y = x - 2 and y = x - 3 (same slope, different y-intercept, so not parallel)

Each distractor corresponds to a potential misconception: students may think that lines are parallel if they have the same y-intercept (options A and C) or if they have the same slope (option B).

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand equivalent fractions"
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is "9/12", which is an equivalent fraction of 3/4. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect common misconceptions, such as:

* 3/3 (a misconception that equivalent fractions must have the same numerator)
* 4/6 (a misconception that equivalent fractions must have the same denominator)
* 2/3 (a random, incorrect answer)

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand equivalent fractions"
    }
]

Let me explain what's happening here:

* The question asks students to identify an equivalent fraction to 2/4.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to recognize equivalent fractions.
* The correct answer is 1/2, which is an equivalent fraction to 2/4.
* The misconception is that students may not understand equivalent fractions, which is the same misconception as in your original example. This misconception might lead students to choose incorrect answers, such as 3/6 or 4/8, which are not equivalent to 2/4.

Here's the explanation:

Question Text: "Which of the following pairs of lines are parallel?"
 options:
A) y = 2x + 3 and y = 2x - 2
B) y = 3x - 2 and y = 4x + 1
C) y = x + 2 and y = x + 5
D) y = 2x - 3 and y = 3x + 1

The correct answer is A and C, because they have the same gradient (m) but different y-intercepts (c).

The misconception targets students who might think that lines can be parallel if they have the same y-intercept (c) or the same gradient (m), which is not the case.

        "misconception": "When solving a problem that requires an inverse operation (e.g. missing number problems), does the original operation"

Let me explain how this example works:

* The question text presents a problem that requires the application of division to find the number of boxes the bakery can fill.
* The construct "Solve division problems involving positive integers" represents the specific skill being targeted by this question.
* The correct answer is 30, which can be obtained by dividing 120 by 4.
* The misconception being targeted is the same one as before: the idea that when solving a problem that requires an inverse operation, the original operation should be performed instead of its inverse. In this case, the student may mistakenly think that they need to multiply 120 by 4 to get the answer, rather than dividing 120 by 4.

        "misconception": "Does not realise that the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than the third side for it to be a possible triangle"

Here's the explanation:

* The question presents three options:
    - A: 7 cm, 5 cm, 2 cm (distractor: sums of two shorter sides are not greater than the third side)
    - B: 10 cm, 7 cm, 5 cm (correct: sums of two shorter sides are greater than the third side)
    - C: 9 cm, 8 cm, 6 cm (correct: sums of two shorter sides are greater than the third side)
    - D: 12 cm, 8 cm, 3 cm (distractor: sums of two shorter sides are not greater than the third side)

The construct targets the specific skill of constructing a triangle using Side-Side-Side, and the misconception is the same as before: the student may not realize that the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than the third side for it to be a possible triangle.

Here's how I designed this question:

* The question text presents a simple linear equation to solve.
* The construct is the same as in the previous example, as it targets the same skill.
* The answer is the correct solution to the equation.
* The misconception is the same as before, as it's a common mistake students make when solving equations involving negative integers.

In this case, a student who chooses an incorrect answer (e.g., x = 2 or x = 10) might be demonstrating the misconception that they "head towards zero" when subtracting from a negative, rather than performing the correct operation to solve the equation.

Note that the question and answer are different, but the construct and misconception remain the same. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect common mistakes that students might make, such as switching the order of the operations or failing to follow the arrows through the function machine.

Misconception 1210/4370:
Here is another example:

[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Solve one-step linear equations, with the variable on one side, with all positive integers",

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question asks students to identify the correct step to solve the equation 2x + 5 = 11. The correct answer is to subtract 5 from both sides. However, a common misconception is that students might think they should add 5 to both sides (instead of subtracting), which is the same operation rather than the inverse.

This misconception is the same as the one you provided, and it targets the same construct of solving one-step linear equations with the variable on one side and all positive integers.

            "answer": "Subtract 5 from both sides, then divide both sides by 3"

            "construct": "Solve one-step linear equations with addition or subtraction",

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

In this example, the distractors could be:

* x = 14 - 3 (applying the same operation, subtraction, rather than the inverse, addition)
* x = 14 + 5 (applying the same operation, addition, rather than the inverse, subtraction)
* x = 3 + 5 (applying the same operation, addition, rather than the inverse, subtraction)

Note that the misconception is the same as the one you provided, but the question, construct, and answer are different.

        },
        "misconception": "When describing a translation, goes from the image to the original"
    }
]

Here, the question shows two shapes A and B, where shape B is a translation of shape A. The correct answer is the vector that describes the translation from A to B, which is (-2, 4). The misconception is the same: the student might think that the vector should describe the translation from the image (B) back to the original (A), rather than from A to B.

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks about the number of data points above 28⁰C, but the misconception is that the student might give the number of data points below 28⁰C instead.
* The construct is still "Interpret continuous data using a line graph" because the question requires the student to interpret the line graph to find the answer.
* The answer is "2" because there are two data points above 28⁰C in the graph.

    {
        "question": {
            "text": "How many days in a week have an average temperature above 20°C?",
            "construct": "Interpret continuous data using a line graph",

        },
        "misconception": "Includes a data point with the value, when asked to find the number of data points above a value"
    }
]

Here's a brief explanation of the question:

The question is asking about the number of days in a week with an average temperature above 20°C. The line graph shows the average temperature for each day of the week.

The correct answer is 5, which can be determined by counting the number of data points above the 20°C mark on the graph.

The misconception being targeted is the same as before: the student may mistakenly count the data point with a value of 20°C itself, rather than counting the number of data points above that value.

Let me break it down:

* The question asks about the total internal angle of a regular hexagon.
* The construct (or skill) being targeted is the ability to calculate a missing angle given the properties of a regular polygon.
* The correct answer is 720 degrees, which is a fundamental property of regular polygons.
* The misconception being addressed is the same one you mentioned: "Does not know the meaning of the word regular". In this case, a student who doesn't understand the meaning of "regular" might not know that all internal angles of a regular hexagon are equal, leading them to choose an incorrect answer.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) targeting the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following is the most appropriate word to describe: 2x + 5",

        },
        "misconception": "Confuses an expression with a term"
    }
]

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question text presents a simple algebraic expression, 2x + 5, and asks the student to identify the most appropriate word to describe it.
* The correct answer is "Expression", which corresponds to the construct "Recognise and name an expression".
* The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Confuses an expression with a term". In this case, a student who holds this misconception might choose a distractor like "Term" instead of "Expression".

    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question shows a 24-hour digital clock displaying 08:45.
* The correct answer is 08:45, which requires the student to understand the correct way to read a 24-hour digital clock with times before the hour.
* The misconception targetted is "Gets the minutes and hours the wrong way around", which is the same as in your original example. This misconception implies that the student might confuse the hour and minute values, e.g., thinking the clock shows 45:08 instead of 08:45.

In this example, the question targets the same construct ("Interpret numbers in a frequency table") and misconception ("Believes total frequency in a table is found by counting rows") as the original example. The correct answer is 30, which is calculated by multiplying the frequency of each number of books by the number of books itself, and then summing up the results.

        },
        "misconception": "Performs addition ahead of multiplication"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question targets the construct "Use the order of operations to carry out calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division". The correct answer is the one that follows the correct order of operations (PEMDAS): first multiply 3 and 2, then add 11, and finally subtract 4.

The misconception is "Performs addition ahead of multiplication", which means that the student may think that the addition operation should be performed before the multiplication operation, leading to an incorrect result.

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"

]

Let me explain the question:

The question text presents an expression that requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to evaluate. The correct answer is 11, which can be obtained by following the correct order of operations: 2 × 3 = 6, then add 4 to get 10, and finally subtract 1 to get 11.

The misconception targeted by this question is that some students may perform the operations from left to right, without considering the priority order, which would lead them to a different (incorrect) answer.

        "misconception": "Confuses perimeter and area"
    }
]
```

Let me explain this example:

The question is asking for the area of a rectangle, but only provides information about the perimeter. The correct answer is "Cannot be determined" because there are many possible rectangles with a perimeter of 20 cm, but without more information, we can't determine the area.

The distractors for this question would be other possible answers that might seem plausible to someone who confuses perimeter and area, such as "10 cm^2" or "20 cm^2".

The construct is "Distinguish between perimeter and area in a rectangle" because the question is trying to assess whether the student can tell the difference between these two concepts.

The misconception is, of course, "Confuses perimeter and area", which is the same as in your original example. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which might be chosen by a student who thinks that the perimeter and area are related in a way that they are not.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation 12x = 48. What is the value of x?",
            "construct": "Solve one-step linear equations requiring multiplication or division, with all positive integers",
            "answer": "4"
        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, subtracts instead of dividing"
    }
]

Let me explain this question:

* The question asks the student to solve a simple linear equation, 12x = 48, which requires division to solve for x.
* The correct answer is 4, which is obtained by dividing both sides of the equation by 12.
* The misconception targets students who might subtract 12 from both sides instead of dividing, which is an incorrect approach.

Misconception 1317/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. How many miles does it travel per hour?",
            "construct": "Interpret data from a simple graph or chart",

        },
        "misconception": "When reading graph, chooses nearest marked value on axis instead of reading accurately"
    }
]

Let me explain:

In this question, the construct "Interpret data from a simple graph or chart" is being targeted. The correct answer is 60 miles per hour, which can be calculated by dividing 240 miles by 4 hours.

The misconception is that students might choose the nearest marked value on the axis, for example, 50 or 70, instead of calculating the exact answer. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which I haven't provided in this example, but they would be something like 50, 70, and 80.

        },
        "misconception": "Incorrectly factorises a quadratic"

Let me explain this question:

* The question text asks students to solve for x in the equation √(x + 2) = 5, and to choose a correct first step.
* The construct targeted is "Solve equations involving square roots".
* The correct answer is to square both sides of the equation to get x + 2 = 25.
* The misconception is that students might think that taking the square root of x + 2 means taking the square root of each term separately, rather than the whole expression. This misconception would lead them to a wrong solution.

    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The construct "Subtract proper fractions with different denominators where one is a multiple of the other" is similar to the previous example, requiring students to subtract fractions with different denominators.
* The question text asks students to subtract $\frac{1}{6}$ from $\frac{2}{3}$, which requires students to find an equivalent fraction for $\frac{2}{3}$ with a denominator of 6.
* The correct answer is $\frac{1}{6}$, which requires students to change the numerator from 2 to 4 when finding the equivalent fraction.
* The misconception "Forgets to change the numerators when finding equivalent fractions" is targeted because a student who holds this misconception might simply change the denominator to 6 without adjusting the numerator, leading to an incorrect answer.

            "answer": "0.5"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not know the definition of a rational number"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

* The correct answer is 0.5, which is a rational number because it can be expressed as a finite decimal or a ratio of integers (1/2).
* The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be numbers like π, √2, or e, which are irrational numbers.
* The misconception targeted by this question is the same as in the previous example: the student may not know the definition of a rational number, which is why they might choose an irrational number instead.

Misconception 1362/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

[
    {

            "answer": "3/4"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not know the definition of a rational number"
    }
]


In this example, the correct answer is actually "None of the above" (since 3/4 is a rational number), but the distractors would be other numbers that are also rational, to tempt students who don't know the definition of a rational number to choose an incorrect answer.

In this question, the student is asked to extract the speed of object A from a distance-time graph. The correct answer is 12 km/h, but the distractors are designed to appeal to students who may read the value from the wrong axes, such as reading the time from the y-axis instead of the x-axis.

        },
        "misconception": "Reads the wrong scale on the protractor when measuring reflex angles"
    }
]

Here's the explanation:

* The question asks students to measure a reflex angle using a protractor.
* The construct targeted is "Use a protractor to measure angles between 180° and 360°", which is a specific skill related to protractor use.
* The correct answer is 235°.
* The misconception identified is "Reads the wrong scale on the protractor when measuring reflex angles", which is a common mistake students might make when measuring reflex angles using a protractor.

Here's the diagram for the question:

![A 360 degree protractor with 2 red lines and a pink sector marking out an angle being measured by the protractor. The outer scale goes from 0 to 360, clockwise. The angle is a reflex angle that is between the red line that is at 0 (outer scale) and 180 (inner scale) on the protractor and goes clockwise round to the red line that is halfway between 220 and 230 (outer scale) and halfway between 340 and 330 (inner scale).]()

            "answer": "(3, 6)"
        },
        "misconception": "Fails to reflect across mirror line"
    }
]

Here, the question is asking students to reflect a point Q in a diagonal line (y = x), and the correct answer is (3, 6). The construct targeted is "Reflect a point in a diagonal line, where the line of reflection lies on the edge or outside the point". The misconception is the same as in your example, "Fails to reflect across mirror line", which means that students may not correctly reflect the point across the line of reflection.

        "misconception": "When solving an equation forgets to eliminate the coefficient in front of the variable in the last step"

Let me explain the question:

The question text asks the student to solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11. The correct answer is x = 3, which can be obtained by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 2.

The construct targeted by this question is "Solve basic linear equations with constants on both sides", which represents the specific skill required to answer the question correctly.

The misconception targeted by the distractors is "When solving an equation forgets to eliminate the coefficient in front of the variable in the last step". This misconception might lead a student to incorrectly solve for x by simply subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, resulting in 2x = 6, and then stopping there, without dividing both sides by 2 to get x = 3.

* The construct is "Divide a decimal by another decimal", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is 5, which is the result of the division operation.
* The misconception is that students might think that dividing by a decimal is the same as dividing by its reciprocal (in this case, multiplying by 2), which is an incorrect understanding of decimal division.

            "answer": "No"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

In this question, the construct being targeted is the ability to identify prime numbers. The correct answer is "No", because 2 is a prime number that is even. The misconception being addressed is that students may assume that all prime numbers are odd without considering the example of 2.

Misconception 1488/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the construct "Sum of interior angles of a polygon" and the correct answer is that the sum depends on the number of sides. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with common misconceptions, such as assuming that the sum is always a certain value or that it doesn't change with the number of sides. The misconception "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples" is reflected in the distractors, which might be based on limited or superficial understanding of the concept.

Misconception 1490/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation x^2 = 16.",
            "construct": "Solve quadratic equations using square roots",

        },
        "misconception": "Only considers the positive solution when calculating a square root"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks the student to solve a quadratic equation using square roots.
* The construct name "Solve quadratic equations using square roots" represents the specific skill or knowledge that the question is targeting.
* The correct answer is "x = ±4", which is the solution to the equation x^2 = 16.
* The misconception "Only considers the positive solution when calculating a square root" corresponds to a common mistake that students might make, which is to only provide the positive solution (x = 4) and forget about the negative solution (x = -4).

Misconception 1491/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Solve radical equations",
            "answer": "x+2 = 16"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes the inverse of square rooting is halving"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the thought process behind this example:

* The question is designed to target the construct "Solve radical equations", which is a specific skill that students should possess.
* The correct answer is "x+2 = 16", which is obtained by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.
* The misconception "Believes the inverse of square rooting is halving" is targeted by this question, as a student with this misconception might think that the inverse of square rooting is simply dividing by 2, and would therefore arrive at an incorrect answer, such as x+2 = 2.

Misconception 1492/4370:
Here is another example:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation (x-2)^2 = 16",
            "construct": "Solve quadratic equations using balancing",
            "answer": "x = 6 or x = -2"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes you can subtract from inside brackets without expanding when solving an equation"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks the student to solve a quadratic equation by manipulating the given equation to isolate x.
* The construct targeted is "Solve quadratic equations using balancing", which means the student should be able to balance the equation by applying inverse operations to isolate the variable.
* The correct answer is "x = 6 or x = -2", which can be obtained by expanding the brackets and solving the resulting quadratic equation.
* The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Believes you can subtract from inside brackets without expanding when solving an equation". This means that the student may think they can simply subtract 16 from inside the brackets to get (x-2)^2 - 16 = 0, and then solving for x without expanding the brackets.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following is a common factor of $3x^2$ and $6x$?",
            "construct": "Identify factors of algebraic expressions",
            "answer": "$3x$"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to identify common factors from algebraic terms"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question targets the construct "Identify factors of algebraic expressions", which is the skill of identifying common factors from algebraic terms.

The correct answer is $3x$, because it is a factor of both $3x^2$ and $6x$.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* $x^2$ (incorrect because it is not a factor of $6x$)
* $6$ (incorrect because it is not a factor of $3x^2$)
* $9$ (incorrect because it is not a factor of either $3x^2$ or $6x$)

Each of these distractors corresponds to a potential misconception, such as not understanding how to identify factors, or not being able to recognize the correct factor. However, the specified misconception is "Does not know how to identify common factors from algebraic terms", which is the primary misconception targeted by this question.

            "answer": "9"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not correctly apply the commutative property of multiplication"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question is designed to test the student's understanding of multiplying a decimal by an integer. The correct answer is 9 (since 2 × 4.5 = 9).

The distractors (not shown in this format) would be designed to reflect the misconception that the student does not correctly apply the commutative property of multiplication. For example, a distractor could be "4.5 × 2" (implying that the student thinks the order of factors matters) or "2 + 4.5" (implying that the student confuses multiplication with addition).

The construct "Multiply a decimal by an integer" represents the specific skill being targeted, and the misconception "Does not correctly apply the commutative property of multiplication" highlights the potential error that the student may make.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes multiplication is not commutative"

Let me explain the question:

* The question text asks students to identify the correct statement about multiplying 2.4 by 3.
* The correct answer is "2.4 × 3 = 3 × 2.4", which corresponds to the construct "Commutative property of decimal multiplication".
* The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect the misconception that multiplication is not commutative, such as "2.4 × 3 ≠ 3 × 2.4" or "You can't swap the numbers in a multiplication problem".

Let me explain the thought process behind this DQ:

* The construct I targeted is still "Carry out missing number multiplication problems involving negative integers", which is a specific skill that students should be able to apply.
* The question text presents a multiplication equation with a negative integer, where the student needs to find the value of x.
* The correct answer is x = -3, which requires the student to understand that two negatives multiply to a positive.
* The misconception I'm trying to diagnose is the same as before: "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer". If a student holds this misconception, they might choose an incorrect answer, such as x = 3, or even a nonsensical answer.

By crafting this DQ, I aim to pinpoint whether a student has this specific misconception and provide targeted feedback or support to help them overcome it.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following statements is true?",
            "construct": "Compare integers with different number of digits",
            "answer": "420 is less than 5021"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not equate the value of a number with the place value column it is in"
    }
]

Here's a breakdown of the question:

* The correct answer is "420 is less than 5021" because 420 is indeed less than 5021.
* Distractor 1: "420 is greater than 5021" (misconception: student thinks 420 is greater because it has a larger first digit)
* Distractor 2: "Both numbers are equal" (misconception: student doesn't understand how to compare integers with different number of digits)
* Distractor 3: "5021 is less than 420" (misconception: student reverses the comparison)

This question targets the construct "Compare integers with different number of digits" and is designed to diagnose the misconception "Does not equate the value of a number with the place value column it is in".

Let me explain:

* The question text shows a right-angled triangle on a square grid with a base length of 6 units and a perpendicular height of 4 units. The containment rectangle has an area of 6 x 4 = 24 square units.
* The correct answer is NOT 12, but half of the area of the containment rectangle, which is 12.
* The misconception is that the student might think the area of the triangle is equal to the area of the containing rectangle, which is not the case.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A point Q is reflected in the line y = x. What are the coordinates of Q' ?",
            "construct": "Reflect an object or a point in a diagonal line with the line of reflection drawn, where the line of reflection lies on the edge or outside the object",
            "answer": "(3, 4)"
        },
        "misconception": "Counts the squares rather than the diagonals when reflecting in y=x or y=-x"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question asks students to find the reflection of a point Q in the line y = x. The correct answer is (3, 4). The distractors for this question could be:

* (4, 3) ( Swap x and y coordinates, a common mistake)
* (6, 0) (Counting squares instead of diagonals)
* (-3, -4) (Reflecting in the wrong direction)

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as before: "Counts the squares rather than the diagonals when reflecting in y=x or y=-x". This question assesses the student's ability to reflect a point in a diagonal line, specifically when the line of reflection is y = x.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "The point R is reflected in the line y = x. What are the coordinates of R'?",
            "construct": "Reflect an object or a point in a diagonal line with the line of reflection drawn, where the line of reflection lies on the edge or outside the object",
            "answer": "(5,3)"
        },
        "misconception": "Counts the squares rather than the diagonals when reflecting in y=x or y=-x"
    }
]
```

In this question, the student is asked to reflect the point R in the line y = x. The correct answer is (5,3), but the distractors would be designed to test the student's tendency to count the squares rather than the diagonals when reflecting in y = x or y = -x. For example, one distractor might be (7,1), which would be the result of counting the squares rather than the diagonals.

            "answer": "4"
        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up sides of a ratio"
    }
]

In this question, the correct answer is 4 units of sugar (since the ratio is 2:5, and we have 10 units of flour, we need 4 units of sugar). The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Mixes up sides of a ratio", which would lead a student to incorrectly answer 5 units of sugar (swapping the ratio) or another incorrect answer.

        "misconception": "Writes the variable before the coefficient in an algebraic term"

```

In this example, the question targets the construct of simplifying algebraic expressions by collecting like terms involving just one linear variable. The correct answer is 3x. The distractors would be designed to correspond with the misconception of writing the variable before the coefficient in an algebraic term, such as x3, x2x, or xx3.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

* The correct answer is x = 3, which can be obtained by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 3.
* A student who holds the misconception "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse" might add 2 to both sides of the equation, instead of subtracting 2, and then divide both sides by 3, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

Misconception 1624/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount"
    }
]

In this question, Sequence A is a linear sequence, but the distractors (not shown) would be sequences that increase or decrease by varying amounts, targeting the misconception that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by the same amount.

Misconception 1625/4370:
Here is another example based on the same Misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount"
    }
]

Note: 

The correct answer corresponds to option B, which is the linear sequence.

Here are the options:
A) 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, ... 
B) 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
C) 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, ...
D) 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount"
    }
]

Here's the breakdown:

* Question Text: "Which of the following sequences is linear?"
* Options:
	+ 2, 4, 8, 16, ... (distractor: increasing by different amounts)
	+ 1, 2, 3, 5, ... (distractor: not increasing by a fixed amount)
	+ 5, 10, 15, 20, ... (distractor: increasing by a fixed amount, but not starting from 0)
* Correct Answer: "None of the above"
* Construct: "Recognise when an ascending sequence is linear"

    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is 45, but the distractors would be designed to correspond with the misconception "Multiplies when converting to a larger unit". For instance, one distractor could be "45000" (multiplying instead of dividing when converting from mm to cm).

        },
        "misconception": "When solving a problem that requires an inverse operation (e.g. missing number problems), does the original operation"
    }
]

Here's the question: 

What should replace the star?
\[ 15 + \bigstar = 10 \]

This question targets the construct of completing missing number mental subtraction problems up to 50, and the answer is 5. The misconception is the same as before, where students might think that the original operation should be used instead of the inverse operation to solve the problem.

        },
        "misconception": "When two digits sum to 10 or more during an addition problem, does not add one to the preceding digit"
    }
]

This question corresponds to the misconception that when two digits sum to 10 or more during an addition problem, the student may not add one to the preceding digit. In this case, the correct calculation is:

25 + 22 = ?

The correct answer is 47, but a student with this misconception might choose a distractor such as 42 (not carrying the 1 from the tens column).

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A rectangular garden measures 10m by 5m. A path of uniform width is built around the garden. If the path is 1m wide, what is the area of the path?",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to find missing lengths in a composite shape"
    }
]

Let me explain this question:

* The question text presents a scenario where a path is built around a rectangular garden, and the student is asked to find the area of the path.
* The construct targets the specific skill of finding a missing length in a composite shape, which requires understanding of geometrical properties.
* The answer is 20m², which can be obtained by finding the area of the larger rectangle (including the path) and subtracting the area of the smaller rectangle (the garden).
* The misconception corresponds to students who struggle to find missing lengths in composite shapes, which is the same misconception as in your original example.

            "answer": "29"
        },
        "misconception": "Rounds down instead of up"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks students to identify a number that rounds to 30 when rounded to the nearest ten.
* The correct answer is 29, because 29 rounds up to 30 when rounded to the nearest ten.
* The construct being assessed is "Round integers to the nearest 10".
* The misconception being targeted is that students may round down instead of up, which would lead them to choose an incorrect answer.

            "answer": "39"
        },
        "misconception": "Rounds up instead of down"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question asks students to identify a number that rounds to 40 when rounded to the nearest 10.
* The correct answer is 39, which requires the student to round down to 40.
* The misconception is that students may instead round up to 40, which would result in an incorrect answer.

        "misconception": "Describes lines when asked to describe angles"
    }
]

The question text shows a diagram with two parallel lines crossed by a transversal, and two marked angles that are alternate interior angles. The student is asked to describe the angles. The correct answer is that they are equal. The misconception is that the student might describe the lines instead of the angles, which is a common mistake.

In this example, the correct answer is that the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other. The distractors (not shown) might include options such as "They are always perpendicular", "They are always of different lengths", or "They never intersect", each corresponding to a potential misconception related to the properties of a rectangle.

        "misconception": "When solving a problem that requires an inverse operation (e.g. missing number problems), does the original operation"
    }

```

In this example, the question targets the construct of finding the combined rate of two people working together. The answer is 2 hours. However, the distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception that the original operation (in this case, addition or multiplication) should be used to solve the problem, rather than finding the inverse operation (in this case, combining the rates).

]

Let me explain how this DQ works:

* The question text presents a function machine problem where the output is 12 and the operation is multiplication by ¼. The student is asked to find the input.
* The correct answer is 48, which is the input that would produce 12 when multiplied by ¼.
* The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Thinks the inverse of addition is division". In this case, a student with this misconception might think that the input is 12 ÷ ¼ = 3, which is an incorrect answer.
* The distractors (not shown explicitly) would be designed to correspond with this misconception, such as 3, 12 ÷ 4, or other incorrect calculations.

]

Let me explain the distractors:

* Distractor 1: "Add 2 to both sides" - This distractor targets the misconception that the student may think that only the x-term needs to be isolated, without considering the constant term.
* Distractor 2: "Divide both sides by 2" - This distractor targets the misconception that the student may think that dividing both sides by the coefficient of x will solve for x, without considering the constant term.
* Distractor 3: "Add 11 to both sides" - This distractor targets the misconception that the student may think that adding the constant term to both sides will eliminate it, without considering the x-term.

The correct answer is "Subtract 5 from both sides", which is the correct first step to solve for x.

Let me explain the question:

The question text presents a two-step linear equation with a fraction, similar to the previous example. The student is asked to identify the first step to solve for x.

The correct answer is "Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation", which is the correct first step to isolate the term with the variable.

The other options (not shown) would be distractors, designed to correspond with common misconceptions, such as:

* Trying to multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction ( incorrect)

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question targets the construct "Solve two-step linear equations, with the variable on one side, involving positive integers". The correct answer is "subtract 5 from both sides", as we need to get rid of the +5 on the left-hand side of the equation.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) could be:

* "add 5 to both sides" (using the same operation rather than the inverse)
* "divide both sides by 2" (incorrect operation)
* "subtract 11 from both sides" (incorrect number)

The misconception is that students might think they need to use the same operation (+5) to get rid of it, rather than using the inverse operation (-5).

            "answer": "(-1, 3)"
        },
        "misconception": "Fails to reflect across mirror line"
    }
]

The question text shows a point A with coordinates (3, 3) and a vertical line x = 2. The student is asked to find the new coordinates of point A after a reflection in the line x = 2. The construct is similar to the previous one, but this time it targets reflection in a vertical line. The answer is (-1, 3), which is the correct reflection of point A in the line x = 2. The misconception remains the same, "Fails to reflect across mirror line", which is a common mistake students make when reflecting points in a line.

            "construct": "For a given output find the input of a function machine",
            "answer": "7"
        },
        "misconception": "Thinks the inverse of subtraction is multiplication"
    }
]

This question targets the same construct as the original example, but with a different function machine. The correct answer is 7, because if you subtract 2 from 9, you get 7. The misconception is the same, as some students may think that to find the input, they need to multiply the output by 2, rather than subtract 2.

Misconception 1711/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question targeting the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the value of x in the equation 2x - 5 = 11?",
            "construct": "Solve a linear equation by adding or subtracting the same value to both sides",
            "answer": "8"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes subtraction is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

The question requires the student to solve a linear equation by adding or subtracting the same value to both sides. However, the misconception "Believes subtraction is commutative" might lead a student to think that subtracting 5 from both sides (i.e., 2x = 11 + 5) is equivalent to subtracting 5 from 11 and then adding the result to both sides (i.e., 2x = 16 - 5). This would result in an incorrect solution, and the correct answer is x = 8.

        },
        "misconception": "When calculating the area of a rectilinear compound shape, calculates the area of the surrounding rectangle"
    }
]

Here is the explanation:

* The question is designed to assess the student's ability to calculate the area of a compound shape made up of two rectangles.
* The construct represents the specific skill being targeted, which is calculating the area of a compound shape involving rectangles and squares with dimensions in the same units.
* The answer is the correct area of the L-shaped compound shape.
* The misconception corresponds to the incorrect strategy of calculating the area of the surrounding rectangle, which is a common mistake students might make when faced with this type of problem.

Misconception 1715/4370:

[

        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question is asking to apply a linear function to an input, which is represented by the function machine. The correct answer is 21, which is calculated by multiplying 3 by 2 and then adding 3 (following the function machine's rules).

The misconception targeted here is the same as before: "Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling". This means that a student who holds this misconception might choose an incorrect answer, such as 9 (which is 3 squared) or 6 (which is 3 multiplied by 2, but without adding 3). The distractors would be designed to correspond to these common misconceptions.

            "construct": "Follow order of operations to evaluate an expression",

        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }

Misconception 1719/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```
[

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is 14, which can be obtained by following the order of operations (PEMDAS): first dividing 12 by 3, then adding 8, and finally subtracting 2. However, if a student carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order, they may arrive at a different answer, such as 2 (by first dividing 12 by 3, then subtracting 2, and finally adding 8).

Misconception 1720/4370:

        "misconception": "Thinks you can find missing values in a given table by treating the row as linear and adding on the difference between the first two values given."
    }
]

Here is the table corresponding to the question:

| x  | 1  | 3  |
|----|----|----|
| y  | 3  | *  |

The student is expected to fill in the correct value for y when x is 3. The correct answer is 5, as y = x + 2 implies that when x is 3, y is 3 + 2 = 5. The misconception targets students who might think they can find the missing value by adding the difference between the previous two values (in this case, 3 - 1 = 2), which would lead them to an incorrect answer.

]

In this example, the distractors could be:

In this example, the question targets the construct of identifying the region of a graph that satisfies a linear inequality in two variables.

Let me explain:

* The question text asks about the order of rotational symmetry of the letter S.
* The construct is the same as before, "Identify the order of rotational symmetry of a shape", which is the skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "1", because the letter S has no rotational symmetry.
* The misconception is the same as before, "Does not know how to find order of rotational symmetry", which is the potential misconception that students may have.

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

The question asks for the number that, when squared, gives 9. The correct answer is 3, since 3² = 9.

However, a student who believes the inverse of square rooting is halving might think that the correct answer is 4.5, since they would be applying a halving operation to 9, rather than taking the square root. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which could include options like 4.5, 2, and 18, each of which corresponds to a different incorrect approach to finding the number that, when squared, gives 9.

Let me explain:

* The question text is asking students to identify a common multiple of 3 and 6.
* The construct being targeted is "Identify common multiples of two numbers", which is a specific skill that students should possess.
* The correct answer is "18", because 18 is indeed a common multiple of 3 and 6.
* The misconception being targeted is "Does not use the associative property of multiplication to find other factors of a number", which means that students who get this question wrong might not be using the correct strategy to find common multiples.

        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies rather than adds when given the command word 'more'"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks the student to find a number that is 25 more than 456.
* The correct answer is 481 (456 + 25).
* The construct being targeted is the ability to find another number more than a given number.
* The misconception being addressed is the common mistake of multiplying rather than adding when given the command word "more". In this case, the student might mistakenly multiply 456 by 25 instead of adding 25 to 456, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "When multiplying a fraction by an integer, multiplies both numerator and denominator by the integer"
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) because \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) multiplied by 4 is equivalent to 2 multiplied by 4, which is 8, and then divided by 3. The distractors could be:

* \\(\\frac{8}{12}\\) (multiplying both numerator and denominator by 4)
* \\(\\frac{2}{12}\\) (multiplying only the numerator by 4)
* \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) (not performing any operation)

These distractors correspond to the misconception that when multiplying a fraction by an integer, both the numerator and denominator should be multiplied by the integer.

        "misconception": "When dividing decimals, does not realize that the order and position of the digits (relative to each other) has to remain constant."

In this example, the correct answer is 0.06, but the distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception, such as incorrectly moving the decimal point or not understanding the effect of division on the decimal.

            "answer": "4.5"
        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies rather than divides"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is 4.5 liters, since 4500 milliliters is equal to 4.5 liters. The misconception being targeted is that the student might multiply instead of divide to convert between milliliters and liters, leading to an incorrect answer.

Misconception 1824/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {

        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols"
    }
]

Here's the explanation:

* The question is asking students to identify the region that satisfies the inequality 2x - 3y > 6, which requires them to graph the line and shade the correct region.
* The construct being targeted is "Represent the solution to a graphical inequality involving a diagonal line", which is a specific skill related to graphing inequalities.
* The correct answer is "B", which corresponds to the region above the line.
* The misconception being targeted is "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols", which means that students might mistakenly shade the region below the line instead of above it, or vice versa.

* 4 (since it's a factor of the final digit 4 in 24, but not a common factor of 24 and 36)
* 8 (since it's a factor of 24, but not a common factor of 24 and 36)

The correct answer is 6, which is a common factor of both 24 and 36. The misconception targeted by this question is that students might think that a factor of the final digit (in this case, 4) is also a factor of the whole number, which is not always the case.

Let me explain:

* The question text asks students to identify the name of a quadrilateral with four equal sides.
* The correct answer is "Rhombus" because a rhombus is a quadrilateral with four equal sides.
* The construct targeted is "Identify a rhombus from a description of the properties", which represents the specific skill or knowledge required to answer the question correctly.
* The misconception is "Believes an arrowhead has four equal sides", which is the same misconception as in your original example. This misconception is likely to tempt students who are not familiar with the properties of a rhombus and might mistakenly choose "Arrowhead" as the answer.

In this question, the correct answer is to subtract 2x from both sides, which is the inverse operation of the addition/subtraction operation in the original equation. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception, such as "Add 2x to both sides" or "Multiply both sides by 2x", which represent using the same operation rather than the inverse.

In this example, the question is testing the student's ability to combine rates of work to find the time it takes for two people to complete a task together. The correct answer is 2 hours, but the misconception "Mixes up the value of two terms when substituting" might lead a student to choose a distractor answer, such as 10 hours (by adding the times instead of combining the rates).

Let me explain this example:

The question targets the construct of calculating the distance between two coordinates in 2D, where all the values are positive integers. The correct answer is the distance formula √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).

The misconception behind this question is that students might confuse the method for finding the gradient of a line segment (which is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) with the method for finding the length of a line segment (which is the distance formula). This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which are not shown here but would be part of a fully developed Diagnostic Question.

Let me explain the question:

* The question text presents a scenario where the student is asked to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
* The construct targets the student's ability to recognize that the quadratic formula can only be applied to equations in the form ax² + bx + c = 0.
* The correct answer is "Rearrange the equation to make it equal to zero", which implies that the student needs to transform the given equation into the standard form before applying the quadratic formula.
* The misconception is the same as the one you provided, which is that the student may not realize that a quadratic must be in the form ax²+bx+c=0 to be factorized or solved using the quadratic formula.

* The question text presents a simple linear equation where the student needs to isolate x.
* The construct name describes the specific skill required to solve this question, which is rearranging linear equations to make x the subject when the x term is positive.
* The correct answer is x = 3.
* The misconception target is the same as before, as this question is designed to diagnose students who struggle with making a variable the subject of an equation.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes distance is the area under the graph on a displacement time graph"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking students to calculate the distance travelled by the car during the 5-second period. The correct answer is 37.5 m, which can be calculated using the equation of motion: distance = average speed x time.

The construct targeted by this question is the ability to calculate missing values from a velocity-time graph, which requires an understanding of the relationship between velocity, time, and distance.

The misconception targeted by the distractors is the belief that distance is the area under the graph on a displacement-time graph. This misconception might lead students to incorrectly calculate the distance as the area under the velocity-time graph, rather than using the correct method.

        },

In this example, the question requires the student to read a value from a graph where the x-axis (time) has a different scale than the y-axis (temperature).

            "answer": "120"
        },
        "misconception": "Counts the starting number when counting backwards"
    }
]

Let me explain the logic behind this question:

The construct "Count the number of groups when counting forwards" is related to the ability to multiply the number of groups (shelves) by the number of items in each group (books) to find the total number of items.

The misconception "Counts the starting number when counting backwards" is targeted by making the distractors (incorrect options) related to counting from the starting point (0 or 1) instead of correctly multiplying the number of groups by the number of items in each group.

For example, a distractor could be "15" (counting the starting number of shelves), "8" (counting the starting number of books on each shelf), or "16" (including the starting point of 0).

        },
        "misconception": "Believes numbers are divisible by numbers which sum to their factors"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text is designed to test the student's understanding of the relationship between different factors of a number.
* The correct answer is "3" because 9 is a factor of the number, and 3 is another factor (since 3 x 3 = 9).
* The distractors (not shown) would be carefully crafted to represent the misconception, such as "6" (since 3 + 6 = 9) or "12" (since 3 + 9 = 12).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more examples.

Misconception 1934/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

            "answer": "False"
        },
        "misconception": "Thinks numbers are divisible by all multiples of their factors"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question is designed:

* The question text is trying to elicit the misconception that numbers are divisible by all multiples of their factors. In this case, the student may think that since 6 is a factor, 18 (which is a multiple of 6) must also be a factor.
* The correct answer is "False", because just because 6 is a factor of a number, it doesn't mean 18 is also a factor.
* The construct targeted is "Understand the relationship between different factors of a number", which is the specific skill or knowledge that the question is trying to assess.
* The misconception is the same as the one you provided, which is that students think numbers are divisible by all multiples of their factors. This misconception is the main idea behind the distractor in this question.

        },
        "misconception": "Assumes fractions with prime numerators cannot be simplified"
    }
]

Explanation:

* The question targets the construct "Simplify fractions that simplify to a non-unit fraction", which is related to the misconception that fractions with prime numerators cannot be simplified.
* The question presents four options: 3/5, 2/4, 5/7, and None of the above. 
* The correct answer is "None of the above" because all the given fractions have prime numerators and therefore, according to the misconception, cannot be simplified.
* The distractors (3/5, 2/4, and 5/7) are designed to correspond with the misconception, as they all have prime numerators.

Misconception 1937/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Ava claims that a triangle can never have more than one right angle. Is Ava correct?",
            "construct": "Properties of right triangles",
            "answer": "No"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question works:

The question targets the construct "Properties of right triangles", which involves understanding the characteristics of right triangles.

The question stem presents a claim made by Ava, which is incorrect. A triangle can have one or no right angles, but not more than one.

The distractors (not shown explicitly, but implied by the multiple-choice format) would include options like "Yes, Ava is correct" (which corresponds to the misconception) and perhaps other incorrect statements about right triangles.

The correct answer is "No", indicating that Ava's claim is false.

The misconception being targeted is the same as in your example: "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples". In this case, Ava is making a sweeping statement about right triangles without considering the many possible scenarios where a triangle can have only one right angle.

            "answer": "-3"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes adding two negatives gives a positive answer"
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is -3, but the distractors would be designed to reflect the misconception that adding two negatives gives a positive answer, such as +3, 7, or -7.

Misconception 1940/4370:

            "construct": "Multiply two negative integers",
            "answer": "6"

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is 5, which can be obtained by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. The misconception is that students may mistakenly add or subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, rather than using the inverse operation (division) to solve for x.

Misconception 1942/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "When asked for factors of an algebraic expression, thinks any part of a term will be a factor"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question is designed to test the student's ability to identify factors of algebraic expressions, and the correct answer is 4.

In this example, the question is designed to test the student's ability to apply a percentage decrease to a price.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not realise addition is commutative"
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is 10, because the correct order of operations is to add 3 and 2 first, and then add x (which is 5). However, a student who does not realize that addition is commutative may think that the correct order is to add x and 3 first, and then add 2, leading to an incorrect answer.

            "answer": "26"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not realise addition is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain how I designed this question:

* The question targets the construct "Substitute positive integer values into expressions involving no powers or roots", which is a fundamental skill in algebra.
* The correct answer is indeed 26, since 3(2) + 5(3) = 6 + 15 = 21.
* The misconception "Does not realise addition is commutative" implies that the student might think that the order of addition matters, e.g., they might think that 3(2) + 5(3) = 3(2 + 3) + 5 = 3(5) + 5 = 20, which is incorrect.

The other two distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond to other potential misconceptions, such as misunderstanding the order of operations or incorrectly substituting values into the expression.

In this example, the question targets the construct of solving one-step linear equations with fractions. The correct answer is obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, which gives x = 36. The misconception is reflected in the distractors, which might suggest dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by 3, leading to an incorrect solution.

Misconception 1969/4370:

```

Here's how the question works:

* The question text presents a problem where a student needs to calculate the probability of drawing a blue ball from a bag with 4 red balls, 6 blue balls, and 2 green balls.
* The construct targeted by this question is "Calculate probability of a single event", which is a specific skill that represents the most granular level of knowledge relevant to the question.
* The correct answer is "6/12", which is the probability of drawing a blue ball (6 blue balls out of a total of 12 balls).
* The misconception targeted by this question is "Fails to consider all possible outcomes", which means that a student may not consider all the balls in the bag (red, blue, and green) when calculating the probability, leading to an incorrect answer.

        "misconception": "Thinks congruent shapes are the same shape but can be different sizes"

Here's the explanation:

The question is designed to test the student's understanding of congruent shapes. The correct answer is Shapes A and B, which are identical in shape and size, but have different orientations.

The distractors are:

* Shapes A and C, which are the same shape but different sizes (targeting the misconception)
* Shapes B and C, which are different shapes and sizes
* Shapes A, B, and C, which is a distractor intended to confuse the student

The construct "Identify congruence in shapes other than triangles" represents the specific skill being targeted, and the misconception "Thinks congruent shapes are the same shape but can be different sizes" corresponds to the incorrect answer choice.

In this example, the question targets the construct of comparing the sum of interior angles of different polygons.

Let me explain:

The question asks the student to calculate the product of 24 and 9. The correct answer is not provided as an option, and instead, the student is given a choice that represents a common misconception. The correct method would be to use the distributive property, such as 24 × (10 - 1) = 24 × 10 - 24 × 1. However, the given answer choice, "24 × 10 - 24", incorrectly applies the distributive property.

* The misconception "Confuses the calculations for HCF and LCM" is the potential mistake that students may make, in this case, mistakenly calculating the highest common factor (HCF) instead of the LCM.

The distractors for this question could be:

* "12" (HCF of 12 and 15)
* "24" (a common multiple of 12 and 15, but not the lowest)
* "30" (another common multiple, but not the lowest)

These distractors are designed to appeal to students who may be confusing the calculations for HCF and LCM, or who are not applying the prime factor decomposition method correctly.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the lowest common multiple of 12 and 24?",
            "construct": "Use prime factor decomposition to find the Lowest Common Multiple of two numbers",
            "answer": "24"
        },
        "misconception": "forgets to include the common factors when calculating the lowest common multiple"
    }
]
```

This question aims to identify students who may forget to include common factors when calculating the lowest common multiple of two numbers. The correct answer is 24, which is obtained by multiplying the prime factors that are common to both 12 and 24.

Misconception 1991/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) targeting the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "The equation of a line is y = 2x + 1. If y = 7, what is the value of x?",
            "construct": "Given a specific y value, find an x value for a line in the form y = mx + c",

        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up the value of two terms when substituting"
    }
]
```

Let me explain how this question works:

The question text presents a simple linear equation in the form y = mx + c, and asks the student to find the value of x when y = 7.

The construct targeted by this question is the ability to find an x value given a specific y value for a line in the form y = mx + c.

The answer is x = 3, which can be found by substituting y = 7 into the equation and solving for x.

The misconception targeted by this question is "Mixes up the value of two terms when substituting", which means that the student may incorrectly swap the values of x and y, or confuse the coefficients m and c, leading to an incorrect answer.

The distractors (not shown in this JSON format) would be designed to reflect this misconception, for example:

* x = 7 (swapping the values of x and y)
* x = 2 (confusing the coefficient m with the value of x)
* x = 1 (random guess or miscalculation)

By targeting this specific misconception, the question can help identify students who are struggling with this particular concept, and provide targeted feedback and support to help them overcome their misunderstanding.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes that a number divided by itself equals 0"
    }
]

Let me explain the question and the distractors:

* The correct answer is x = 3, which can be found by dividing both sides of the equation by -3.
* The misconception "Believes that a number divided by itself equals 0" would lead the student to think that x = 0, because they might try to divide both sides of the equation by x, which would result in 2 = 6, and then conclude that x = 0.
* The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) could be:
	+ x = 0 ( corresponds to the misconception)
	+ x = 2 (a common mistake when dividing both sides by 2 instead of -3)
	+ x = 6 (a mistake when simply moving the 6 from the right side to the left side)

Let me explain:

* The question is asking students to solve a simple linear equation, which targets the construct of solving linear equations with the variable on one side and all positive integers.
* The correct answer is x = 3.
* The misconception this question targets is the same one you provided, which is that students may use the same operation rather than the inverse when solving an equation. For example, they might subtract 5 from both sides instead of subtracting 5 from both sides to get 2x = 6, and then divide both sides by 2 to get x = 3.

Let me explain the design of this DQ:

* The question text asks students to multiply an integer (2) by a proper fraction (3/4).
* The construct being targeted is the ability to multiply an integer by a proper fraction.
* The correct answer is 1 3/4.

Let me explain:

* The question text asks the student to find the solution to the equation 2x + 3 = 7, but instead of solving it algebraically, it directs them to use the graph of y = 2x + 3.
* The construct is the same as before, "Given a sketch of a linear graph, solve f(x) = n", which targets the student's ability to read the solution from the graph.
* The answer is x = 2, which can be read from the graph.
* The misconception is the same as before, "Believes the solution to mx + c = a is the y intercept of y = mx +c", which reflects a common mistake students make when trying to solve equations using a graph.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the gradient of the line that passes through the points (2,5) and (4,3)?",
            "construct": "Given two points, calculate the gradient where the gradient is a negative integer",
            "answer": "-1"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes gradient = change in x/change in y"
    }
]

Let me explain what's happening here:

* The question text asks about the gradient of a line given two points, which requires the student to calculate the gradient.
* The construct name specifies the precise skill being targeted, which is calculating the gradient given two points where the gradient is a negative integer.
* The answer text provides the correct solution, which is -1.
* The misconception corresponds to the incorrect belief that the gradient is equal to the change in x over the change in y, which is a common mistake students make when calculating gradients.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```
[

        },
        "misconception": "Believes nth term rule can be given in words"
    }
]
```

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to find the nth term of a sequence, which targets the construct "Find the nth term rule for an ascending integer linear sequence".
* The correct answer is "2n", which is a numerical expression for the nth term.
* The misconception is that students might think they can give a verbal description of the nth term rule, such as "add 2 each time" or "start with 2 and increase by 2", rather than providing a mathematical expression.

    }
]

This question targets the same construct as the previous one, but with a different question stem. The correct answer is \\frac{1}{2}, but students who hold the misconception may choose an incorrect answer, such as \\frac{5}{7}, which is the result of multiplying the numerators and adding the denominators.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to find the order of rotational symmetry"
    }

Let me explain the question:

* The question text asks students to identify a shape with a rotational symmetry order of 3.
* The construct being targeted is the same as before: identifying the order of rotational symmetry of a shape.
* The correct answer is an equilateral triangle, which has a rotational symmetry order of 3.
* The misconception being targeted is the same as before: the student may not know how to find the order of rotational symmetry of a shape, leading them to choose an incorrect answer. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with this misconception, such as a rectangle or a non-equilateral triangle.

            "answer": "x=3"
        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies by the index"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks students to find the value of x in the equation 4^x = 8^2.
* The correct answer is x=3, which requires changing the base 8 to base 4.
* The construct targeted is "Change an integer base number to another integer base number with a positive integer power".
* The misconception "Multiplies by the index" corresponds to a potential distractor answer, where students might simply multiply 8 by 2 to get x=16, rather than correctly changing the base.

            "construct": "Solve one-step linear inequalities in one variable where the variable appears on one side of the equation",
            "answer": "m = 4"
        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols"
    }
]

Let me explain how I designed this question:

The question text asks students to solve a simple one-step linear inequality, which targets the construct "Solve one-step linear inequalities in one variable where the variable appears on one side of the equation".

The correct answer is m = 4, because 3m < 12 implies m < 4.

The misconception "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols" is targeted, as a student with this misconception might incorrectly think that m = 4 is not a solution because they swap the direction of the inequality, thinking it's a "greater than" symbol instead of "less than".

Misconception 2079/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve the inequality: 3x < 12. Is x = 5 a solution to the inequality?",
            "construct": "Determine if a given value is a solution to a one-step linear inequality in one variable",
            "answer": "No"
        },
        "misconception": "When using inequality notation, thinks 'greater than/less than or equal to' symbols are instead the 'greater than/less than' symbols and vice versa"
    }
]

Let me explain the thought process behind this question:

The question construct is "Determine if a given value is a solution to a one-step linear inequality in one variable", which targets a specific skill.

The correct answer is "No", because x = 5 does not satisfy the inequality 3x < 12.

The distractors (not shown in this format) could be:

* "Yes, because 3x is less than 12 when x is 5" (misconception: confusing <= with <)
* "Yes, because x can be any value greater than 5" (misconception: misunderstanding the direction of the inequality)
* "We can't determine if x = 5 is a solution without more information" (misconception: lack of understanding of how to evaluate an inequality)

The misconception targeted is the same as in your original example: "When using inequality notation, thinks 'greater than/less than or equal to' symbols are instead the 'greater than/less than' symbols and vice versa". This misconception can lead students to incorrectly evaluate inequalities, and this question is designed to diagnose that mistake.

    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text "What is the value of 3 × 2 + 11 - 4?" requires the student to apply the order of operations (PEMDAS) to calculate the correct answer.
* The construct "Use the order of operations to carry out calculations involving multiplication and addition" specifies the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is indeed 25, which can be calculated by following the order of operations: 3 × 2 = 6, then 6 + 11 = 17, and finally 17 - 4 = 25.
* The misconception "Answers order of operations questions with brackets as if the brackets are not there" corresponds to the idea that students might ignore or misunderstand the importance of following the order of operations, leading them to calculate the expression incorrectly.

In this example, the question targets the construct of using the order of operations to carry out calculations involving multiple operations. The correct answer is 10, but a student who holds the misconception may think that the operations need to be performed in strict order, i.e., division before addition before subtraction, and therefore arrive at a different answer.

Let me explain this example:

* The question text invites the student to find the ratio of blue blocks to total blocks in a picture (not shown here, but assume a diagram with 3 blue blocks and 2 non-blue blocks).
* The construct "Express pictorial representations of objects as a ratio" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is 3/5, which is the ratio of blue blocks to total blocks.
* The misconception "When writing fraction from diagram, writes total as denominator" corresponds to a potential mistake students might make, where they might write the total number of blocks (5) as the denominator instead of the correct ratio.

Note: The distractors for this question would be options like:

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]

Let me explain how I designed this question:

The question requires the student to solve a simple linear equation. The correct process involves subtracting 5 from both sides and then dividing both sides by 2. However, students who carry out operations from left to right regardless of priority order might first multiply both sides by 2, which would lead to an incorrect solution. This misconception is targeted by the distractor options, which could include answers like "5.5" or "22".

        },
        "misconception": "When multiplying decimals, divides by the wrong power of 10 when reinserting the decimal"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

In this question, students need to find the combined rate at which Sally and John can paint the room, which involves adding their individual rates. To do this, they need to convert their rates from "time to complete" to "rate per hour", which involves dividing 1 by the time (e.g., 1/4 hour and 1/6 hour). The misconception targets the step where students reinsert the decimal point when performing this division, which can lead to incorrect calculations.

        },
        "misconception": "Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (rounds too much)"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question asks the student to round 842 to the nearest 10.
* The construct is "Round integers to the nearest 10", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The answer is 840, which is the correct result of rounding 842 to the nearest 10.
* The misconception is "Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (rounds too much)", which means that the student might choose an answer that rounds 842 to a different degree of accuracy, such as 800 or 850, instead of 840. This misconception is the same as the one in your original example.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain how this example targets the same misconception:

In this question, the student is asked to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable x. The correct approach is to use inverse operations, i.e., subtract 5 from both sides and then divide both sides by 2. 

However, a student who holds the misconception "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse" might try to add 5 to both sides (instead of subtracting) or multiply both sides by 2 (instead of dividing), leading to incorrect solutions. This misconception is therefore embedded in the distractors, making it a Diagnostic Question that can help identify students who struggle with using inverse operations to solve equations.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer"
    }
]

Let me explain how this example targets the same misconception:

In this question, the correct answer is that the equation cannot be factorized. However, a student who holds the misconception that multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer may think that the equation can be factorized, for example, as (x - √6)(x + √6) or some other incorrect factorization. This misconception leads them to choose an incorrect answer, such as one of the non-existent factors.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes there is a multiplicative relationship between values of terms in a linear sequence e.g. 10th term is double 5th term"
    }
]

Let me explain what's going on here:

The question text describes a sequence of numbers, and the student is asked to predict the value of the 8th term.

The construct being targeted is the ability to use a linear sequence to make a prediction about another term in the sequence, other than the next one.

The answer is 26, which can be obtained by recognizing the linear pattern in the sequence.

The misconception being targeted is the same one as before: believing that there is a multiplicative relationship between values of terms in a linear sequence (e.g., thinking that the 10th term is double the 5th term).

Misconception 2201/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Understand the relationship between parts of a ratio",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand that in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n"
    }
]

Let me explain the thinking behind this question:

The question is designed to test the student's understanding of the relationship between parts of a ratio. The correct answer is 2/7, because out of a total of 7 parts (2 sugar + 5 flour), 2 parts are sugar.

The distractors (not shown in this output) would be designed to correspond with common misconceptions that students might have about ratios. For example:

* 2/5: This distractor corresponds to a student who thinks that the ratio 2:5 means that 2 parts out of 5 are sugar (rather than understanding that the total number of parts is 2 + 5 = 7).
* 1/2: This distractor corresponds to a student who thinks that the ratio 2:5 means that there are equal parts of sugar and flour (rather than understanding that there are 2 parts sugar for every 5 parts flour).

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as the one you provided: "Does not understand that in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n". This misconception is likely to lead students to choose one of the distractors, rather than the correct answer.

Misconception 2202/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand that in a ratio 1:n that one part of the ratio would be n times bigger than the one part"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question targets the construct "Use ratio to solve a problem", and the correct answer is 6 (since the ratio is 2:3, there are 3 parts of cakes for every 2 parts of muffins, and 2 + 3 = 5 parts in total, so there are 3/5 of 12 = 6 cakes).

The distractors (not shown) could be:

* 4 (thinking that the ratio 2:3 means there are 2 cakes for every 3 muffins, or vice versa)
* 9 (thinking that the ratio 2:3 means there are 2 groups of 3 cakes and muffins)
* 12 (thinking that the ratio 2:3 means there are 2 cakes and 3 muffins in total)

These distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception that students may have, which is "Does not understand that in a ratio 1:n that one part of the ratio would be n times bigger than the one part".

Misconception 2203/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand that in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n"

]

Let me explain:

In this question, the student is asked to find the total number of parts in a ratio of sugar to flour (2:5). The correct answer is 7 (2 + 5). However, a student with the misconception that "in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n" would likely answer 6 (2 + 5, mistakenly treating the ratio as 1:5). This misconception is the same as in your original example, but with a different context and ratio.

            "construct": "Identify perpendicular lines written in the form y = mx + c",

        },
        "misconception": "Believes the gradients of perpendicular lines are reciprocals of the same sign"
    }
]

This DQ targets the misconception that students may have, where they think that the gradients of perpendicular lines are reciprocals of the same sign, rather than reciprocals of opposite sign. The correct answer, y = -1/3x + 1, has a gradient that is the negative reciprocal of the original line, while the distractors (not shown) would reflect the misconception.

            "answer": "Equation"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses an equation with an expression"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question stem asks students to identify the definition of a statement, which is an equation in this case.
* The construct "Recognise and name an equation" requires students to accurately identify and label the given statement as an equation.
* The correct answer is "Equation".
* The misconception "Confuses an equation with an expression" reflects a common mistake students make when they fail to distinguish between equations and expressions. In this case, they might choose an incorrect answer, such as "Expression", due to this misconception.

        },
        "misconception": "Chooses an example when asked for a counter-example"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question is asking students to identify a counter-example to the statement "All quadrilaterals are rectangles".
* The correct answer is "A trapezoid", because a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that is not a rectangle.
* The misconception being targeted is "Chooses an example when asked for a counter-example", which means that some students might choose a quadrilateral that is a rectangle (e.g. a square) as their answer, rather than a quadrilateral that is not a rectangle.

            "answer": "2:3"
        },
        "misconception": "Thinks ratios are written as 1:total"
    }
]

In this example, the question is asking about the ratio of the perimeters of two triangles, and the correct answer is 2:3. The misconception is the same as before, where the student thinks that ratios should be written as 1:total, which would lead them to a distractor answer such as 1:5.

Misconception 2223/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

            "construct": "Recognise when a square root is a surd and when it is not",

        },

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a surd will simplify to a whole number and not longer be a surd if the number under the surd is a square number"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The correct answer is `\( \sqrt{16} \)`, which is not a surd because it can be simplified to a whole number (4). The other options would be distractors, such as `\(\sqrt{20}\)`, `\(\sqrt{30}\)`, and `\(\sqrt{32}\)`, which are all surds.

The construct being targeted is the ability to recognize when a square root is a surd and when it is not. The misconception being addressed is the same as the one you provided, which is the idea that a surd will always remain a surd and not simplify to a whole number if the number under the surd is a square number.

        "misconception": "Thinks there are 100 mg in a gram"

Note that the question is designed to target the same misconception as the original example, but with a different question stem and correct answer. The distractors for this question would likely include options that reflect the misconception, such as 2.5 grams or 25 grams.

Here is another example:

            "answer": "5000"
        },
        "misconception": "Divides when converting to a smaller unit"
    }
]

Let me explain how this example works:

* The question asks students to convert 5 kilograms to grams, which targets the construct of converting between kilograms and grams.
* The correct answer is 5000 grams, since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams.
* The misconception "Divides when converting to a smaller unit" might lead students to think that they need to divide 5 kilograms by a certain amount to get the number of grams, rather than multiplying it by 1000. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which would be incorrect answers such as 0.005 or 0.05 grams.

Misconception 2256/4370:

Misconception 2257/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 identical boxes. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many boxes can be placed on it in total?",

            "answer": "40"
        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies up without finding unit amount"
    }
]
```

In this example, the student is likely to be tempted to multiply 5 (number of shelves) by 5 (a incorrect unit amount) to get 25, rather than multiplying 5 by 8 (the correct unit amount) to get 40. This question targets the same misconception as the original example, which is that the student fails to find the unit amount before multiplying up.

Misconception 2258/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[

        "question": {

            "construct": "Multiply 2 digit integers by 2 digit integers using long multiplication",

        },
        "misconception": "When two digits multiply to 10 or more during a multiplication problem, does not add carried value to the preceding digit"
    }
]

Note: The incorrect working for this question could be something like:

```
  45
x 27
----
 135
  90
----
 2615 (incorrect)
```

In this case, the student is not carrying the tens digit when multiplying the tens place of 27 by the units place of 45.

Misconception 2259/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the result of multiplying 45 by 27?",
            "construct": "Multiply 2 digit integers by 2 digit integers using long multiplication",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not write the place holder zero when doing column multiplication"
    }
]

Let me explain the question and its components:

* The question text asks the student to find the result of multiplying 45 by 27, which requires applying the construct of multiplying 2-digit integers by 2-digit integers using long multiplication.
* The correct answer is 1215, which can be obtained by performing the long multiplication correctly.
* The misconception corresponds to a common error students make when performing column multiplication, which is not writing the placeholder zero. This can lead to an incorrect final answer.

Misconception 2260/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "When reading graph, chooses nearest marked value on axis instead of reading accurately"
    }
]
```

Here's the graph:

A time-series graph showing the number of loaves sold from 8am to 6pm. The graph shows 50 loaves sold from 8am to 10am, 50 loaves from 10am to 12pm, 75 loaves from 12pm to 2pm, and 75 loaves from 2pm to 6pm.

Misconception 2261/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is 25 minus 9 in your head? You can use mental subtraction strategies. ",
            "construct": "Recognise and use efficient strategies for mental subtraction",
            "answer": "16"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand the effect of consecutive subtractions"
    }
]

Let me explain the example:

The question is testing the student's ability to use efficient strategies for mental subtraction. The construct targets the specific skill of recognizing and using those strategies.

The answer is 16, which is the correct result of 25 minus 9.

The misconception "Does not understand the effect of consecutive subtractions" is the potential mistake that students might make. In this case, they might think that subtracting 10 and then subtracting 1 would give the correct answer, which is not the case.

Misconception 2262/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Recognise and use efficient strategies for mental subtraction",
            "answer": "Incorrect method"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand the effect of consecutive operations"
    }
]

In this example, the distractors would be:

* 19 (if Alex added 2 correctly, but then subtracted 10 incorrectly)
* 27 (if Alex added 2 correctly, and then thought subtracting 10 would give the correct result)
* 17 (if Alex subtracted 10 correctly, but then added 2 incorrectly)

The correct answer is "Incorrect method", as Alex's method of adding 2 and then subtracting 10 is not a correct or efficient strategy for calculating 25 - 8.

            "construct": "Carry out the first stage in an iteration solution",

        },
        "misconception": "When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives the term after"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question tests the student's ability to carry out the first stage in an iteration solution, which involves substituting the given value of x₁ into the formula to find x₂. The correct answer is 5, which is obtained by calculating x₂ = 2x₁ - 1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5.

The misconception targeted by this question is that students might give the term after x₂, which would be x₃, instead of calculating x₂ correctly. This misconception is similar to the one you provided, where students might give the term after the one asked for in the question.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, thinks the divisor and dividend are the opposite way around"
    }

In this question, the correct answer is 6, as x = 12 ÷ 2 = 6. The misconception is that students might think the divisor and dividend are the opposite way around, so they would write x = 2 ÷ 12, which is incorrect.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 boxes of books. How many boxes of books can the bookshelf hold in total?",
            "construct": "Apply multiplication to solve real-world problems",

        },
        "misconception": "Adds instead of multiplies when calculating total frequency"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking students to calculate the total number of boxes of books that the bookshelf can hold. The correct answer is obtained by multiplying the number of shelves (5) by the number of boxes each shelf can hold (8), which is 40.

The distractors for this question would be:

* 5 + 8 = 13 (addition instead of multiplication)
* 5 x 1 = 5 (ignoring the number of boxes each shelf can hold)
* 8 x 1 = 8 (ignoring the number of shelves)

These distractors correspond to the misconception "Adds instead of multiplies when calculating total frequency".

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Multiplication to find total number of items",

        },
        "misconception": "Subtracts rather than multiplies when calculating total frequency"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the thought process behind creating this DQ:

* The construct "Multiplication to find total number of items" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The question text presents a scenario where the student needs to multiply the number of shelves and the number of books per shelf to find the total number of books that can be placed on the bookshelf.
* The correct answer "Number of shelves × Number of books per shelf" reflects the correct application of the construct.
* The misconception "Subtracts rather than multiplies when calculating total frequency" suggests that the student may mistakenly subtract the numbers instead of multiplying them, which is a common error.

Here, the question is asking for the area of a rectangle with a length of 4cm and a width of 6cm. The correct answer is 24 cm², which is the product of the length and width. The misconception is that the student might multiply all three dimensions (length, width, and diagonal) instead of just the length and width.

This question features a parallelogram with a base length of 4cm, a perpendicular height of 6cm, and a slant length of 7cm.

Let me explain the question:

The question shows a triangle with angles A, B, and C. The student is asked to identify which statement is always true about the triangle.

The correct answer is that angles A and B are supplementary, which is a property of triangles.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) could be:

* "Angle C is always 90 degrees" (a misconception that assumes a special case is always true)
* "The sum of angles A, B, and C is 180 degrees" (a partial truth, but not always true)
* "Angles A and B are always equal" (a misconception that assumes a false symmetry)

The misconception targeted is "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples", which is the same as in your original example.

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to solve a simple linear equation where the variable x is in the denominator.
* The construct targets the specific skill of solving one-step linear equations with the variable in the denominator.
* The correct answer is to multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction.
* The misconception is the same as before: students may think that the inverse operation is to make x the numerator on the other side, which is incorrect.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes you write the carried value in the number rather than adding it to the next place value column"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question presents a two-step linear equation with a positive decimal, and asks students to identify the correct first step to solve for x. The correct answer is 2x = 3.6, which involves subtracting 1.8 from both sides of the equation.

The distractors (not shown) could include options like "2x = 5.4 - 1" or "2x + 1.8 - 1.8 = 5.4 - 1.8", which would reflect the misconception that you write the carried value in the number rather than adding it to the next place value column.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes division is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question is designed to test the student's understanding of the non-commutativity of division, which means that the order of the dividend and divisor matters.
* The correct answer is "24 ÷ 3 ≠ 3 ÷ 24", which reflects the understanding that division is not commutative.
* The misconception targeted by this question is the same as the one you provided, which is the belief that division is commutative.

Misconception 2373/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {

        },
        "misconception": "Reflects in an axis, instead of the given mirror line"
    }
]

This question features a similar construct and misconception as the original example. The question text asks students to reflect a point F in the line x = 2, and the correct answer is (4, 5). The misconception targetted is still "Reflects in an axis, instead of the given mirror line", where students may incorrectly reflect the point F in the x-axis or y-axis instead of the given line x = 2.

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks that when raising a variable with a coefficient to a power, only the coefficient is affected by the power"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the same construct (multiplying algebraic terms involving non-linear versions of the same letter) and the same misconception (thinking that only the coefficient is affected by the power). The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as \( 3^4x^2 \) or \( 3x^8 \), making it apparent that the student who chooses one of these incorrect options is holding this specific misconception.

Misconception 2377/4370:

            "answer": "None of the above"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not know the meaning of perpendicular"
    }
]

The question text shows three options:

A) ![Two parallel lines with no marks]()
B) ![Two intersecting lines with a right angle mark]()
C) ![Two lines that are not straight, but rather curved and intersecting]()

Distractors:

A) Students may choose this option because they think parallel lines are perpendicular.
B) Students may choose this option because they think any intersecting lines are perpendicular.
C) Students may choose this option because they think any intersecting lines, even if not at a right angle, are perpendicular.

The correct answer is "None of the above" because none of the options show perpendicular lines. This question targets the same misconception as before: students may not know the meaning of perpendicular.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean"
    }
]

Here's a breakdown of the example:

* The question text asks about the meaning of a small line across a rectangle, which is a common notation for indicating measurement.
* The construct targeted is "Recognise notation for measurement", which represents the specific skill or knowledge required to answer the question correctly.
* The correct answer is "The length of the rectangle".
* The misconception corresponding to this question is "Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean", which is the same misconception as in your original example. This misconception would lead students to choose an incorrect answer, such as thinking the small line indicates something other than measurement.

* The question text asks the student to convert a fraction (3/25) to a decimal.
* The construct being targeted is "Convert fractions less than 1 to terminating decimals of 2 decimal places", which is a specific skill that the student should possess.
* The correct answer is "0.12", which is the correct decimal equivalent of the fraction 3/25.
* The misconception being targeted is the same one you provided, which is "Converts a fraction to a decimal by using only the numerator after the decimal point". In this case, the student might be tempted to write "0.3" as the answer, which is incorrect.

        "misconception": "Believes the sides of a rectangle must be horizontal and vertical, not diagonal"

Let me explain the question:

The question shows a rectangle with three vertices labeled A, B, and C, with coordinates (2,3), (5,6), and (8,3), respectively. The student is asked to find the coordinates of point D, the fourth vertex of the rectangle. The correct answer is (5,3), which requires the student to recognize that the rectangle is not aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes. The misconception being targeted is the belief that rectangles must have horizontal and vertical sides, which would lead the student to incorrect answers.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to simplify algebraic fractions"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks the student to simplify an algebraic fraction.
* The construct targeted is "Simplify an algebraic fraction by cancelling common factors", which means the student should be able to identify and cancel out the common factors between the numerator and denominator.
* The correct answer is "2 + 3/x", which is obtained by cancelling out the common factor of 4 between the numerator and denominator.
* The misconception targeted is that the student "Does not know how to simplify algebraic fractions", which means they may not be familiar with the process of cancelling out common factors or factorising the numerator and denominator.

Let me explain how this question is designed:

* The question text presents a scenario where the student needs to use division to solve a real-world problem.
* The construct targeted is "Interpret and carry out mental division to solve a real-world problem", which is a specific skill that I want to assess.
* The correct answer is 6, which requires the student to perform mental division correctly.
* The misconception "Estimated when not appropriate" suggests that the student might not use division and instead try to estimate the answer, which is a common mistake in this type of problem.

In this example, the question is designed to target the "Multiply to find the total number of items in a set" construct, which requires the student to understand that the 5 shelves can hold 8 boxes each, and therefore the total number of boxes that can be placed on the bookshelf is 5 x 8 = 40. The misconception that the amount given (5 shelves, 8 boxes per shelf) is for the whole rather than a part may lead some students to think that the answer is simply 5 or 8, which are the incorrect distractors.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

            "answer": "8"
        },
        "misconception": "Fails to consider all possible outcomes"
    }
]

In this example, the question is asking about the number of possible outcomes when a coin is flipped three times. The correct answer is 8, since there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT). The misconception is "Fails to consider all possible outcomes", which is the same as the previous example.

```

In this example, the question presents a scenario where a fair six-sided die is rolled, and the student is asked to identify the correct sample space. The correct answer is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which lists each possible outcome only once. The misconception targeted is that a student may believe the sample space should include repeated outcomes, such as S = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6}, which is incorrect.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes greater than/less than symbols include end values"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question is asking students to identify which of the answer choices satisfies the inequality 2x - 5 > 3. The correct answer is x > 4.

The construct being targeted is "Solve one-step linear inequalities in one variable where the variable appears on one side of the equation", which is the skill required to solve the inequality.

The misconception being targeted is "Believes greater than/less than symbols include end values", which might lead students to think that x ≥ 4 (including 4) is the correct answer, whereas the correct answer is x > 4 (excluding 4).

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* x ≥ 4 (including 4, which is a common mistake due to the misconception)
* x < 4 (a basic algebra mistake)
* x = 4 (another common mistake, thinking the solution is an exact value rather than an inequality)

[

            "construct": "Solve a linear equation in one variable",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Changes the given operation when substituting"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question asks students to solve a simple linear equation, and the correct answer is x = 3.

The construct targeted by this question is the ability to solve a linear equation in one variable.

The misconception that this question is designed to diagnose is the tendency to change the given operation when substituting, which is a common mistake that students make when solving equations.

In this case, a student who holds this misconception might, for example, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation instead of subtracting 5 from both sides, or divide both sides by 2 instead of subtracting 5, leading to an incorrect solution. The distractors (not shown in this format) would be designed to reflect this misconception.

Misconception 2549/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "2x + 3 = 7, what is the value of x?",
            "construct": "Solve a linear equation in one variable",
            "answer": "x = 2"
        },
        "misconception": "Changes the given operation when substituting"
    }
]


In this example, the question is asking students to solve a linear equation in one variable, and the correct answer is x = 2. The misconception targeted by the distractors is "Changes the given operation when substituting", which means that students may mistakenly change the operation (e.g. addition to subtraction, or multiplication to division) when substituting values into the equation.

Misconception 2550/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception "substitutes incorrectly":

[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Solve linear equations with one variable",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "substitutes incorrectly"
    }
]

In this example, the distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect common incorrect substitutions, such as substituting 2x with 2, or adding 5 to both sides of the equation instead of subtracting 5. The correct answer, x = 3, requires the student to correctly substitute and solve for x.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes negative numbers with a larger absolute value are greater"
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is -5°C, and the distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception that negative numbers with a larger absolute value are greater. For example, the distractors might include options like -3°C, -2°C, or -1°C, which would be incorrect because they are not as cold as -5°C.

Misconception 2586/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the value of x in the equation: 5 - x = 2?",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations in one variable where subtraction is involved and the variable is on the right-hand side.",
            "answer": "3"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes subtraction is commutative"
    }
]
```
In this question, the correct answer is 3, because to solve for x, you need to add 5 to both sides of the equation, resulting in x = 7 - 5 = 2. The misconception targets students who might think that subtraction is commutative, and therefore might think that 5 - x = 2 can be rewritten as x - 5 = 2, which would lead to an incorrect solution.

Misconception 2587/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[

        },
        "misconception": "When asked for the mean of a list of data, gives the mode"
    }
]

Here is the set of data:
$$2, \quad 3, \quad 3, \quad 4, \quad 3$$

This question targets the same construct as the previous example, but with a different set of data. The correct answer is the mean of the data, which is 3. The misconception is that the student might give the mode (which is also 3 in this case) instead of calculating the mean.

Misconception 2588/4370:
Here is another example based on the same Misconception:

[

            "construct": "For a given algebraic input, find the output of a function machine",
            "answer": "\(x \Rightarrow \times3 \Rightarrow +2\)"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked."
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer is "\(x \Rightarrow \times3 \Rightarrow +2\)", which follows the correct order of operations in the function machine. The distractors (not shown) would include options that change the order of operations, such as "\(x \Rightarrow +2 \Rightarrow \times3\)" or "\(x \Rightarrow \times2 \Rightarrow +3\)".

Misconception 2591/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

            "construct": "For a given algebraic input, find the output of a function machine",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked."
    }
]

Let me explain this question:

* The question text asks the student to find the output of a function machine when the input is 3.
* The construct name is the same as before, as this question is also testing the student's ability to find the output of a function machine.
* The correct answer is "6 + 2", which is obtained by following the arrows in the correct order: 3 → ×2 → +2 → 6 + 2.
* The misconception is the same as before, as this question is designed to catch students who don't follow the arrows in the correct order, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving simultaneous equations thinks that identical terms in given equations can be eliminated by either adding or subtracting."
    }
]

Note that the distractors (incorrect options) for this question could be:

* Add the two equations together
* Multiply the two equations together
* Divide the two equations by each other

Each of these distractors corresponds to a potential misconception that a student may hold, but the correct answer is to subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the variable y.

        },
        "misconception": "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text presents a linear sequence, and the student is asked to identify the next number in the sequence.
* The construct targets the student's ability to recognize patterns in number sequences.
* The answer is 17, which is the next number in the sequence.
* The misconception corresponds to the idea that when faced with a linear sequence, some students may struggle to identify the pattern or visualize how the sequence is generated, leading them to choose an incorrect answer. The distractors (not shown in this JSON format) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as a nonlinear or random value.

Misconception 2601/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text is a linear sequence, and the student is asked to identify the next number in the sequence.
* The construct being targeted is "Identify the next number in a linear sequence", which represents the specific knowledge or skill required to answer the question correctly.
* The correct answer is "14", which is the next number in the sequence.
* The misconception is the same as in your example: "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern". This misconception represents a common error that students may make when trying to answer this type of question. In this case, the distractors (not shown) might include options that are not part of the linear sequence, but might be mistakenly chosen by students who struggle to visualize the pattern.

            "answer": "31"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question targets the construct "Identify prime numbers", which represents a specific skill.
* The correct answer is 31, which is a prime number.
* The distractors (incorrect options) are:
	+ 1: This is a common misconception, as 1 is not considered a prime number in mathematics.
	+ 27: Some students might think 27 is prime because it's not an "obvious" composite number, but it can be factored as 3^3.
	+ 36: This is clearly not prime, but some students might not think to check its factors.
* The misconception behind these distractors is that students may not consider enough examples or think critically about what makes a number prime, simply assuming a fact without adequate evidence.

Misconception 2604/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

```json
[
    {

            "construct": "Determine whether a number is odd or even",
            "answer": "False"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]
```

In this question, the distractors are implicit, as the student may think that if a number ends in 5, it is always odd (which is not true, e.g., 105 is not an odd number). The misconception targeted is the same as the one you provided, assuming a fact without considering enough examples.

Misconception 2605/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

            "answer": "No"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question text presents a statement that can be easily refuted with a counterexample (2 is a prime number, but it's even).
* The construct "Identify prime numbers" represents the specific knowledge being targeted.
* The answer "No" is the correct response, as not all prime numbers are odd.
* The misconception "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples" is the same as in the previous example, as the incorrect answer assumes that all prime numbers are odd without considering the counterexample of 2.

This question targets the same construct as the original example, and the misconception is the same. The distractors for this question could be:

* Input -> +2 -> ×3 -> Output (changes the order of operations)
* Input -> ×2 -> +3 -> Output (incorrect operations)
* Input -> -2 -> ×3 -> Output (incorrect operations)

        },
        "misconception": "Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked."
    }

Here is the corresponding function machine:

![function machine with "x" written inside the first rectangle on the left and "input" written above it; it has "+5" written inside the next rectangle, "×2" written inside the next rectangle and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "y" written inside it.]()

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[

            "construct": "For a given algebraic input, find the output of a function machine",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked."
    }
]

In this question, the student is presented with a function machine:

p → ÷ 2 → + 2

The correct answer is 4, because the machine first divides the input (2) by 2, resulting in 1, and then adds 2, resulting in 4.

The distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception, for example:

* p → + 2 → ÷ 2 (changing the order of operations)
* p → ÷ 4 → + 1 (not following the arrows correctly)

        "misconception": "Thinks adding the same value to each side makes shapes similar"
    }
]

Here's a brief explanation of the question:

The question features three options:

A) Two triangles with side lengths 3-4-5 and 6-8-10
B) Two triangles with side lengths 3-4-5 and 6-8-12
C) Two triangles with side lengths 3-5-7 and 6-10-14

Only option B represents a pair of similar triangles. Option A represents a misconception where the student thinks that adding the same value (3) to each side of the original triangle results in a similar triangle. Option C represents another common misconception.

Let me explain how I designed this question:

* The question targets the construct "For a given output find the input of a function machine", which is a different but related construct to the original example.
* The correct answer is "8" because if we work backwards through the function machine, we get: \(11 \longrightarrow -3 \longrightarrow \times 2 \longrightarrow \) Input, which equals 8.
* The misconception is the same as before, "When using a function machine, confuses the input and the output". The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect this misconception, for example:
	+ A distractor that gives the output value (11) as the answer, instead of finding the input.
	+ A distractor that simply reverses the operations in the function machine, without realizing that the input and output values need to be swapped.
	+ A distractor that applies the operations in the wrong order, again due to a confusion between input and output.

Let me explain how this DQ is designed:

* The question text presents a simple linear equation that requires the student to use inverse operations to isolate the variable y.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to use inverse operations to solve for a variable, which is a fundamental skill in algebra.
* The correct answer is y = 3, which requires the student to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation and then divide both sides by 2.
* The misconception being targeted is the same as the one you provided: when solving an equation, the student might use the same operation rather than the inverse. For example, they might add 5 to both sides of the equation instead of subtracting 5, or multiply both sides by 2 instead of dividing by 2.

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks about the property of division, with the correct answer being that it is not commutative.
* The construct targeted is the same as before, namely "Understand the non-commutativity of division".
* The answer text is the correct response, which is that division is not commutative.
* The misconception is the same as before, which is that the student believes division is commutative.

* Division is commutative
* Division is associative
* Division is always 1

Each of these distractors corresponds to a potential misconception, but the specific misconception being targeted is the belief that division is commutative.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```

            "construct": "Understand the concept of commutative property",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand the meaning of the word commutative"
    }
]
```

Let me explain:

* The question text is a multiple-choice question that targets the construct "Understand the concept of commutative property".
* The correct answer is "Multiplication is commutative but division is not", which indicates that the student understands that multiplication is commutative, but division is not.
* The misconception is still "Does not understand the meaning of the word commutative", which corresponds to the distractors (not shown in this JSON format) that would reflect this misconception.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know units of area should be squared"
    }
]
```

Let me explain what's going on here:

* The question text presents three options: cm, m, and m². Only one of them is a unit of area (m²).
* The construct is "Identify a unit of area", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The answer is "m²", which is the correct unit of area.
* The misconception is the same as before: "Does not know units of area should be squared". This misconception corresponds to the distractors "cm" and "m", which are units of length, not area.

Misconception 2675/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the perimeter of this rectangle? ![A rectangle, 5cm by 12cm]()]",
            "construct": "Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle where the dimensions are given in the same units",
            "answer": "34cm"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not recall rectangle side length property"
    }
]

Let me explain how this DQ is designed:

* The question text presents a rectangle with a length of 5cm and a width of 12cm, and asks for the perimeter.
* The correct answer is 34cm, which requires the student to recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2l + 2w) and apply it correctly.
* The construct targeted is "Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle where the dimensions are given in the same units", which requires the student to understand the concept of perimeter and how to calculate it.
* The misconception targeted is "Does not recall rectangle side length property", which suggests that the student may not remember or understand how to work with the lengths and widths of rectangles, leading them to struggle with calculating the perimeter.

Note that the distractors (incorrect options) for this question would be designed to reflect common misunderstandings or misconceptions related to this construct, such as:

* Not using the correct formula for perimeter
* Not accounting for the units of measurement
* Not recognizing the distinction between length and width

These distractors would be crafted to tempt students who hold the targeted misconception, making it more likely that they will select an incorrect option and reveal their misunderstanding.

* A hexagon with all internal angles of equal measure
* A hexagon with a fixed orientation on a plane

        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies by the index"

]
```

Let me explain how this DQ targets the same misconception:

* The question asks students to substitute a value (𝑥 = 4) into an expression involving a power (𝑥³).
* The correct answer is 64, which is obtained by cubing 4 (4 × 4 × 4).

Here is another example of a diagnostic question targeting the same misconception:

[
    {

            "construct": "Solve a quadratic equation where the solution involves the square root of a negative number",
            "answer": "x = 3 + √9 or x = 3 - √9"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes the square of a negative will also be negative"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question works:

* The question asks the student to solve a quadratic equation, which requires the student to take the square root of both sides.
* The correct answer involves taking the square root of 9, which is 3. However, the student may mistakenly believe that the square of a negative (in this case, -3) will also be negative, leading them to a incorrect solution.
* The distractors for this question could be:
	+ x = 3 + √(-9) ( incorrect, due to the misconception)
	+ x = -3 + √9 ( incorrect, just a simple mistake)
	+ x = 3 - √(-9) ( incorrect, due to the misconception)

By using this question, you can diagnose whether a student holds this misconception and provide targeted support to help them overcome it.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

In this question, the construct is "Solve linear equations in one step", which targets the specific skill of solving a simple linear equation. The correct answer is x = 3, which requires the student to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, then divide both sides by 2. The misconception is the same as before, where the student may be tempted to add 5 to both sides of the equation, rather than subtracting 5, or to multiply both sides by 2, rather than dividing by 2.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question text presents a simple algebraic equation with the identity symbol ≡, which is often misunderstood by students.
* The correct answer targets the construct "Understand the meaning of the identity symbol ≡", which is a fundamental concept in algebra.
* The distractors (not shown) could include incorrect answers that reveal the misconception, such as "It means 2(x + 3) is always greater than 2x + 6" or "It means 2(x + 3) is approximately equal to 2x + 6".

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question text presents a scenario where Emma selects 2 marbles at the same time from a bag containing 3 red, 4 blue, and 2 green marbles.
* The construct targeted is "Calculate the probability of two dependent events occurring without drawing a tree diagram", which assesses the student's ability to calculate the probability of an event occurring when given multiple outcomes.
* The answer is "13/18", which is the correct probability of at least one blue marble being selected.
* The misconception targeted is "Does not work out all possibilities when given an 'at least' question in probability", which corresponds to the incorrect assumption that the student will not account for all possible outcomes when solving the problem.

In this example, the question shows a rectangle with a length of 4cm, a width of 6cm, and a diagonal of 10cm (not shown in the JSON output). The correct answer is 24 cm², which is the product of the length and width.

            "answer": "43.8"
        },
        "misconception": "Rounds down instead of up"
    }
]

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The question text asks students to round a number to 1 decimal place, which targets the construct of "Round numbers to one decimal place".
* The correct answer is 43.8, which requires students to round up from 43.847.
* The misconception "Rounds down instead of up" corresponds to a common mistake students might make, which is to round 43.847 down to 43.7 instead of up to 43.8.

        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies rather than divides"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks students to convert meters to kilometers, which targets the "Convert between m and km" construct.
* The correct answer is 6 km/hour, which requires dividing 24,000 meters by 4 hours and then converting meters to kilometers.
* The misconception "Multiplies rather than divides" suggests that some students might multiply 24,000 meters by 4 hours instead of dividing, leading to an incorrect answer.

Here's how I designed the question:

* The question requires the student to apply the concept of combined work rate, which is a specific construct.
* The correct answer is 2 hours, which can be calculated by finding the combined rate of Sally and John, and then finding the time it takes for them to paint the house together.
* The misconception targets the same error as the original example, where the student might forget to eliminate the coefficient in front of the variable in the last step of the solution, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "When finding the difference between two points on a time series graph, only uses one of the points."
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question targets the construct "Calculate average acceleration from a time-series graph", which requires the student to understand how to calculate acceleration from a graph of velocity versus time.

The correct answer is 5 m/s², which can be calculated by finding the change in velocity (20 m/s - 0 m/s = 20 m/s) and dividing it by the time (4 seconds).

The misconception being targeted is the same as before: "When finding the difference between two points on a time series graph, only uses one of the points." In this case, the student might mistakenly use only the initial velocity (0 m/s) or the final velocity (20 m/s) to calculate the acceleration, rather than finding the difference between the two points.

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking the student to convert a fraction (3/8) to a ratio. The correct answer is 3:5, as there are 3 parts sugar out of a total of 8 parts (5 parts being the remaining fraction). 

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* 5:3 (gets the order of ratio wrong, which is the targeted misconception)
* 3:8 (keeps the fraction as is, without converting it to a ratio)
* 1:2 (a random incorrect ratio)

By targeting the "gets order of ratio wrong" misconception, we can identify students who may be struggling with this specific concept and provide targeted support to help them understand it better.

In this example, the correct answer is the calculation of the mean, which is `(2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5`.

Misconception 2812/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks the denominator in a combined probability will be the same as the denominator in the probability of the first event."
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question asks about the denominator of the probability of getting an even number in both rolls of a die. The correct answer is 36, which is the total number of possible outcomes in two rolls of a die (6 × 6).

The distractors for this question could be:

* 2 (thinking that the denominator is the same as the number of sides on the die)
* 6 (thinking that the denominator is the same as the number of possible outcomes in one roll)
* 12 (some other incorrect reasoning)

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as the one you provided: students may think that the denominator in a combined probability will be the same as the denominator in the probability of the first event, which is incorrect in this case.

In this example, the correct answer is x = 3, which requires using the inverse operation of subtraction to isolate the variable x.

            "answer": "C"

        "misconception": "Rotates instead of reflects"

]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks about the effect of reflecting a triangle in a horizontal axis.
* The image shows the original triangle and three possible outcomes.
* The construct is "Reflect a polygon in a horizontal axis", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The answer is "C", which is the correct reflection of the triangle in the horizontal axis.
* The misconception is "Rotates instead of reflects", which corresponds to the distractors "B" (rotated 90 degrees clockwise) and potentially "D" (translated 2 squares to the right, which could be a result of a rotation and translation mistake).

        },
        "misconception": "Cannot identify mutually exclusive events"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text presents a scenario where a student is asked to find the probability of drawing a king or a heart from a fair deck of 52 cards.
* The construct "Understand the term mutually exclusive" represents the specific skill or knowledge that the student is expected to demonstrate.
* The answer "The sum of the probabilities" is the correct response, as drawing a king and drawing a heart are mutually exclusive events (you can't draw a card that is both a king and a heart at the same time).
* The misconception "Cannot identify mutually exclusive events" corresponds to a common mistake students might make, which is failing to recognize that these two events are mutually exclusive, and therefore incorrectly applying the rules of probability.

            "answer": "There is no such roll (0)"
        },
        "misconception": "Cannot identify mutually exclusive events"
    }
]

Let me explain this one:

The question targets the construct "Understand the term mutually exclusive" which means the student should be able to identify when events are mutually exclusive (i.e., cannot happen at the same time).

The correct answer is "There is no such roll (0)" because rolling an odd number and rolling a number greater than 3 are not mutually exclusive (you can roll a 5, for example), but the probability of rolling both at the same time is still 0 because there is no number on a standard six-sided die that is both odd and greater than 3.

The misconception that this question targets is "Cannot identify mutually exclusive events", which is the same as the one you provided.

]

Here, the question text is "Which of the following is true?" and the options are:

A) 3 ÷ 2 = 2 ÷ 3
B) 4 × 2 = 2 × 4
C) 5 - 2 = 2 - 5
D) None of the above

The correct answer is "D) None of the above", as options A and C are false (due to the non-commutativity of division), and option B is true but irrelevant to the construct of division.

Misconception 2828/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

            "answer": "None of the above"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes division is commutative"
    }
]

Note: The question text is designed to test the student's understanding of the non-commutativity of division, and the correct answer is "None of the above" because the distractors are:

A) 2 ÷ 3 = 3 ÷ 2
B) 4 ÷ 5 = 5 ÷ 4
C) 6 ÷ 7 = 7 ÷ 6

These distractors are all incorrect because division is not commutative, and the student who believes division is commutative may be tempted to choose one of these options.

```
[
    {
        "question": {

    }
]
```

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question requires the student to find the y-intercept of a line given a point on the line and a positive gradient.
* The misconception is that the student might think the y-intercept is given by the difference between the x and y coordinates of the point (2,7), which is 5 (7-2), rather than correctly using the point-slope form of the equation to find the y-intercept.

        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up odd and even numbers"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks the student to identify which number is not a prime number.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to identify prime numbers.
* The correct answer is 9, which is not a prime number.
* The misconception that this question is designed to diagnose is the same as in your original example, namely, "Mixes up odd and even numbers". This misconception might lead a student to think that all odd numbers are prime, or that even numbers can't be prime, and therefore choose an even number as the answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know what a square number is"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks the student to identify a square number.
* The construct "Recognise square numbers" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "16", which is a square number (4^2).
* The misconception is the same as before: "Does not know what a square number is", which is a common misunderstanding that might lead students to choose an incorrect answer.

The question text asks about the relationship between corresponding angles, and the construct is "Identify corresponding angles". The correct answer is "They are equal", but the misconception is "Thinks corresponding angles sum to 180 degrees", which is a common mistake students make when dealing with parallel lines.

Here's a brief explanation of the question:

The question shows a triangle with vertices at (-2, 1), (2, 1), and (0, -3). The task is to determine where the vertex at (-2, 1) will be after a 180° rotation around a point. The correct answer is C, which corresponds to the point (2, 1). The misconception targeted is the same as before: rotating by the wrong center of rotation, not including the origin.

            "answer": "3"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes division is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The question text is designed to test the student's ability to divide a decimal by a non-unit decimal (construct).
* The correct answer is 3, which requires the student to perform the division correctly.
* The misconception targeted is the belief that division is commutative (i.e., 0.3 ÷ 0.1 = 0.1 ÷ 0.3), which would lead the student to choose an incorrect answer.

Misconception 2904/4370:
Here is another example of a Question-Construct-Answer triplet and misconception based on the same misconception:

            "answer": "6.4 cm"
        },
        "misconception": "Doubles the diameter when finding the radius"
    }
]

Let me explain what's happening here:

* The question asks for the diameter of a circle given its radius.
* The construct is the same as before, representing the specific skill of recognizing that the diameter is twice the radius.
* The answer is the correct calculation of the diameter based on the given radius.
* The misconception is the same as before, where the student might double the diameter to find the radius, which is an incorrect inference.

Misconception 2905/4370:
Here is another example of a diagnostic question that targets the same misconception:

        },
        "misconception": "Confuses diameter and radius"
    }

In this example, the question targets the same construct of recognizing the relationship between the diameter and radius of a circle. The misconception is also the same, where students may confuse the diameter and radius.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not realise that the area of a triangle is half the area of the containing rectangle"

]

Here's a brief explanation:

* The question text shows a right-angled triangle with a base of 4 units and a height of 3 units.
* The construct is the same as before, targeting the specific skill of calculating the area of a right-angled triangle.
* The correct answer is 6, which is half of the area of the containing rectangle (4 x 3 = 12).

            "construct": "Identify valid nets of a cube",

        },
        "misconception": "Struggles to visualise nets of 3D shapes"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question is asking students to identify which option is NOT a valid net of a cube.
* The construct being targeted is "Identify valid nets of a cube", which is a specific skill that students should possess.
* The correct answer is "rectangle with a triangle attached to each side", because a cube's net consists of six squares, not rectangles with triangles attached.
* The misconception being addressed is "Struggles to visualise nets of 3D shapes", which means that students may have difficulty picturing what a cube's net looks like, leading them to choose an incorrect option.

            "answer": "5"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses pyramid with prism"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question targets the construct "Identify the number of faces in a prism", which requires the student to understand the characteristics of a prism.
* The correct answer is 5, because a triangular prism has 5 faces: 2 triangular faces and 3 rectangular faces.
* The misconception "Confuses pyramid with prism" is targeted because a student who holds this misconception might think that a triangular prism has fewer faces, similar to a triangular pyramid, which has 4 faces.

* The question text presents a scenario where Sara is given a subtraction problem and needs to apply the same operation to a related problem.
* The construct being targeted is the same as in the previous example: "Given the solution to one problem, deduce the answer to a related problem using the same operation".
* The correct answer is 665, which is the result of subtracting 281 from 945.
* The distractors (not shown in this output format) would be designed to correspond with the misconception that "adding a larger number gives a larger answer", which is not applicable in this subtraction context. For example, a distractor might be "667" (suggesting that subtracting a larger number gives a larger answer).

        "misconception": "Believes the constant gives the y-intercept even when a line is not written in the form y = mx + c"

]

Let me explain the question:

The question is targeting the construct of finding the y-intercept of a line written in the form ax + by = c. The correct answer is 2, which can be found by rearranging the equation to the form y = mx + c.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) would be designed to correspond with the misconception, such as:

* "4" (thinking the constant term is the y-intercept)
* "-2" (thinking the coefficient of x is the y-intercept)
* "1" (thinking the coefficient of y is the y-intercept)

These distractors would be designed to appeal to students who hold the misconception that the constant term gives the y-intercept, even when the line is not written in the form y = mx + c.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes direct proportion means a 1:1 ratio"
    }
]
```

In this question, the correct answer is 50 (250 loaves ÷ 5 loaves per packet), but the distractors (incorrect options) are designed to appeal to students who believe that direct proportion means a 1:1 ratio, which would lead them to incorrect answers.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following is true?",
            "construct": "Compare decimal numbers with different numbers of digits",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to compare decimal numbers"
    }
]

This DQ targets the construct of comparing decimal numbers with different numbers of digits, and the correct answer is "0.4 is less than 0.39". The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception of not knowing how to compare decimal numbers.

Misconception 2998/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to compare decimal numbers"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is targeting the construct of comparing decimal numbers with the same number of digits. The correct answer is "0.8 is greater than 0.09". The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) could be:

* "0.09 is greater than 0.8" (a common mistake that shows the student doesn't understand how to compare decimal numbers)
* "0.8 is equal to 0.09" (another mistake that shows a lack of understanding of decimal comparisons)
* "0.8 is less than 0.09" (yet another mistake that shows a lack of understanding of decimal comparisons)

The misconception targeted by this question is the same as before: "Does not know how to compare decimal numbers".

        "misconception": "Thinks terms in linear sequence are in direct proportion"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is `12 - 3n + 3`, which is the formula for the nth term of a descending integer linear sequence. The misconception being targeted is that students may think that the terms in a linear sequence are in direct proportion, rather than having a constant difference between consecutive terms.

    }
]

Misconception 3016/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x: 2/3 = x/12",
            "construct": "Solve a proportion by inverting and multiplying",

        },
        "misconception": "When dividing by a fraction, switches to multiplication without also using the reciprocal"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer involves inverting and multiplying to solve the proportion, but the misconception might lead a student to simply multiply both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in an incorrect solution.

Misconception 3017/4370:
Here is another example:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not reverse the order of operations when solving an equation"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question targets the construct of solving linear equations, and the correct answer is x = 3. The misconception is the same as the one you provided, "Does not reverse the order of operations when solving an equation", which could lead a student to incorrectly solve for x.

Misconception 3018/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = x + 11:",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations with the variable appearing on both sides, with positive and negative integers",
            "answer": "Subtract 5 from both sides, then subtract x from both sides."
        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]
```

In this example, the question targets the same construct as before, but with a different equation. The correct answer involves using the inverse operation to isolate the variable, which is the opposite of the misconception. The distractors (not shown) would reflect this misconception, such as "Add 5 to both sides, then add x to both sides" or "Multiply both sides by 5, then multiply both sides by x".

Misconception 3019/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve the equation: 2x - 3 = x + 2",
            "construct": "Solve linear equations by adding or subtracting the same value to both sides",
            "answer": "Add 3 to both sides, then subtract x from both sides"
        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

In this example, the correct answer involves adding 3 to both sides of the equation, which is the inverse operation of subtracting 3. The misconception targets students who might instead subtract 2 from both sides, using the same operation (subtraction) rather than the inverse operation (addition).

Misconception 3020/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Solve linear equations in one variable",

        },
        "misconception": "Believes 0 is not a real solution to an equation"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the question:

The question targets the construct "Solve linear equations in one variable". The correct answer is "x + 0 = 5" because x + 0 = 5 has no solution (x cannot equal 5 and 0 simultaneously). The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with the misconception that 0 is not a real solution to an equation, e.g., "x = 0" (thinking x cannot equal 0), or "x + 2 = 0" (thinking 0 is not a valid result of an equation).

            "answer": "x = 4"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the construct of solving exponential equations involving integer bases and powers. The correct answer is x = 4, since 2^4 = 16.

The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with potential misconceptions, such as:

* x = 2 (thinking that 2^2 = 16, without considering other possibilities)
* x = 8 (thinking that 2^8 = 16, without considering other possibilities)
* x = 1 (not understanding the concept of exponential equations)

The misconception "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples" is targeted in this question, as students who hold this misconception may not think to try different values of x to find the correct solution.

Here's a brief explanation of the question:

The question asks students to reflect point Q in the x-axis. The correct answer is (3, -2). The misconception targeted is that students may think that point Q will move when reflected, rather than staying on the x-axis (the line of reflection).

* The question text asks students to solve a simple linear equation.
* The construct targeted is "Solve a linear equation in one variable", which represents the specific skill being assessed.
* The correct answer is indeed "6", which requires students to divide both sides of the equation by 2.
* The misconception targeted is "Thinks the inverse of subtraction is multiplication", which might lead some students to multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Adds rather than multiplies for combined probabilities"
    }
]

Let me explain how this example works:

* The question is asking about the total number of possible outcomes when a fair six-sided die is rolled three times.
* The construct being targeted is "Calculate the probability of three or more independent events occurring", which requires the student to understand that the number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each individual event (in this case, 6 × 6 × 6 = 216).
* The correct answer is 216.
* The misconception being targeted is "Adds rather than multiplies for combined probabilities", which means that the student might be tempted to add the number of outcomes for each individual event (6 + 6 + 6 = 18) rather than multiplying them. This misconception would lead to an incorrect answer.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {

            "construct": "Apply the order of operations in a function machine",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked."
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question text shows a function machine with the operations ×2, +3, and ×4 in that order. The correct answer is 10, which is obtained by following the order of operations: 2 × 2 = 4, then 4 + 3 = 7, and finally 7 × 4 = 10.

The construct targets the specific skill of applying the order of operations in a function machine.

The misconception corresponds to students not following the arrows through the function machine and changing the order of operations, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked."
    }
]

Here's the question breakdown:

* Question Text: "What is the output of the function machine when the input is 2?"
* Construct Name: "For a given algebraic input, find the output of a function machine"
* Answer: "10" (assuming the correct function machine is something like `a → × 5 → - 0`)

The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond to the misconception, such as:

* "12" (if the student incorrectly follows the arrows or changes the order of operations)
* "6" (if the student misinterprets the function machine)
* "8" (if the student makes a calculation error)

Here, the correct answer is 6, and the distractors could be:

* 25 (not a factor of 24)

In this example, the question is targeting the construct "Recognise square roots", and the correct answer is 7. The misconception "Squares when asked to find the square root" is reflected in the distractors, which might include options like 49, 2401, or another squared value.

```

In this example, the correct answer is that the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. The misconception is that students might think they can determine the term-to-term rule based on only the first two terms of the sequence, which is not enough information to determine the rule.

In this example, the correct answer is "Add 4 to the previous term", which is the correct term-to-term rule for the sequence. The distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception of using only the first two terms of a sequence to work out a term-to-term rule. For instance, one distractor could be "Add 2 to the previous term", which is a common mistake students make when only considering the first two terms of the sequence.

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to identify the value of the digit 4 in the number 542.
* The construct "Understand place value in 3-digit numbers" targets the specific skill of understanding the place value of digits in 3-digit numbers.
* The correct answer is "Four hundreds", which shows that the student understands that the digit 4 represents 400.
* The misconception "The student does not understand the place value of 3-digit numbers" is the potential mistake that the question is designed to detect. In this case, the student may think the digit 4 represents 40 or 4 units, rather than 400.

    }
]
```

In this example, the question asks about the mode of the numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 7, and the correct answer is that the mode is both 1 and 7. The misconception targeted is the same as before, where the student might think that if there are two numbers with the same frequency, there is no mode.

Misconception 3119/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same Misconception:

[

            "answer": "14"
        },
        "misconception": "Rounds up instead of down"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks students to estimate the square of 3.8, which requires the calculation of the square of a number (hence the construct name).
* The correct answer is 14, which is the result of calculating (3.8)^2.
* The misconception "Rounds up instead of down" suggests that students may have a tendency to round 3.8 up to 4.0 before calculating the square, leading to an incorrect answer.

Misconception 3120/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies by the index"
    }
]


Let me explain what's happening here:

* The question is asking to calculate the cube of 3.5.
* The construct being targeted is "Calculate the cube of a number", which is a specific skill that the student should possess.
* The correct answer is 42.875, which is the result of correctly calculating the cube of 3.5.
* The misconception being targeted is "Multiplies by the index", which is a common mistake that students might make when calculating exponents. In this case, the student might think that to calculate the cube, they simply need to multiply 3.5 by 3, rather than actually cubing the number.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving simultaneous equations, thinks they can't multiply each equation by a different number"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question asks students to solve a system of linear equations using the elimination method. To do so, they need to manipulate the equations to make the coefficients of y's opposites, so they can add the equations to eliminate y. The correct answer is to multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 3, which would make the coefficients of y's opposites.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* Multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 2 ( incorrect, because it doesn't make the coefficients of y's opposites)
* Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 3 (incorrect, because it doesn't make the coefficients of y's opposites)
* Just add or subtract the equations as they are (incorrect, because the coefficients of y's are not opposites)

The misconception being targeted is that students might think they can't multiply each equation by a different number, which is not the case when using the elimination method to solve simultaneous equations.

        "misconception": "Confuses perimeter and area"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks about the area of a rectangle, but only provides the perimeter (24 cm).
* The correct answer is "Cannot be determined with the given information" because the perimeter alone is not enough to calculate the area.
* The construct being targeted is "Given the perimeter of a rectangle, calculate the area", which requires understanding the difference between perimeter and area.
* The misconception is "Confuses perimeter and area", which is the same as the one you provided. In this case, a student who holds this misconception might try to use the perimeter to calculate the area, which would be an incorrect approach.

Misconception 3148/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

In this question, the distractors would be:

* 24.81 ÷ 4 (which would give an underestimate)
* 25 ÷ 3.29 (which would give an overestimate)
* 24.81 ÷ 3 (which is the correct answer)

The misconception is still the same, as students who hold this misconception might think that dividing by a larger number (such as 4) would give a larger answer.

            "answer": "Radius"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses circumference and radius"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question presents a diagram with a line segment from the center of a circle to the edge. The correct answer is "Radius", as the length of the line segment is indeed the radius.

The construct "Distinguish between circumference and radius" targets the specific skill of recognizing the difference between these two concepts.

The misconception "Confuses circumference and radius" is the potential mistake that students may make, where they might mistakenly identify the radius as the circumference or vice versa.

Misconception 3181/4370:

            "answer": "Tangent"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses tangent and circumference"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks about the definition of a tangent, which is a line that touches a circle at exactly one point.
* The construct name is "Distinguish between tangent and circumference", which represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "Tangent".
* The misconception is still "Confuses tangent and circumference", which is the same misconception as before. In this case, the distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as "Circumference" or "Radius".

        },
        "misconception": "Confuses chord and circumference"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question is asking about the name of a specific type of line in a circle, and the correct answer is "Diameter". The misconception being targeted is the same as before, where students may confuse a chord (a line segment within a circle) with the circumference (the distance around the circle). The distractors in this case could include "Circumference", "Radius", and "Chord", each of which corresponds to a specific misconception about the properties of circles.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following operations is commutative?",
            "construct": "Distinguish between commutative and non-commutative operations",
            "answer": "Addition"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand the meaning of the word commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question asks students to identify which operation is commutative.
* The correct answer is Addition, but the distractors could include Subtraction, Division, or other operations that are not commutative.
* The construct targets the skill of distinguishing between commutative and non-commutative operations.
* The misconception is still "Does not understand the meaning of the word commutative", as the student may not grasp the concept of commutativity, leading them to choose an incorrect operation.

Misconception 3187/4370:
Here is another example:

[
    {

            "text": "Which of the following is always true about multiplication?",
            "construct": "Understand the commutative property of multiplication",
            "answer": "The order of the numbers being multiplied does not change the result."
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand the meaning of the word commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

* The question text asks students to consider the properties of multiplication.
* The construct being targeted is the understand the commutative property of multiplication, which is a basic property of arithmetic operations.
* The correct answer is "The order of the numbers being multiplied does not change the result", which is a clear statement of the commutative property.
* The misconception corresponds to a student who may not understand the meaning of the word "commutative", and may think that the order of the numbers being multiplied does matter, or may not understand the concept at all.

This question targets the same construct "Recognise integers expressed visually" and addresses the same misconception as the original example. The image would show four groups of 100 squares, and the student is asked to count the number of hundreds. The distractors would be designed to reflect the misconception, such as counting the total number of squares rather than considering the groups of hundreds.

            "text": "Which of the following represents the statement 'x is greater than or equal to 7'?",
            "construct": "Interpret inequality notation",
            "answer": "x ≤ 7"
        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks the student to identify the correct notation for "x is greater than or equal to 7".
* The correct answer should be "x ≥ 7", but the answer provided is "x ≤ 7", which is incorrect.
* The construct being targeted is "Interpret inequality notation", which is the specific skill or knowledge being assessed.
* The misconception is the same as the one you provided, "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols", which is the potential mistake that students might make when interpreting inequality notation.

Misconception 3226/4370:
Here is another example of a diagnostic question targeting the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11.",
            "construct": "Substitute positive non-integer values into linear equations",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Thinks a variable next to a number means addition rather than multiplication"
    }
]

In this question, the correct answer requires substituting positive non-integer values into a linear equation. The misconception targets students who may mistakenly think that the "2" in "2x" means "add 2" rather than "multiply by 2".

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {

            "construct": "Multiply fractions to evaluate an expression",
            "answer": "3.75"
        },
        "misconception": "When multiplying fractions, multiplies the denominator"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question is designed:

* The question text presents a problem that requires multiplying fractions to evaluate an expression.
* The construct "Multiply fractions to evaluate an expression" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is 3.75, which is obtained by multiplying the fractions correctly.
* The misconception "When multiplying fractions, multiplies the denominator" is the incorrect assumption that might lead students to multiply the denominators (3 and 5) instead of the numerators (2 and 12) and denominators (3 and 5).

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

            "construct": "Recognise perpendicular lines",
            "answer": "GH"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses the meaning of perpendicular and vertical"
    }
]

Misconception 3229/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following line segments are perpendicular to the x-axis?",
            "construct": "Recognise perpendicular lines",
            "answer": "All vertical lines"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses the meaning of perpendicular and vertical"
    }
]

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The question text asks students to identify which line segments are perpendicular to the x-axis.
* The correct answer is "All vertical lines", because a line is perpendicular to the x-axis if and only if it is vertical.
* The misconception targeted is "Confuses the meaning of perpendicular and vertical", which means that students may mistakenly think that only horizontal lines or lines with a specific gradient are perpendicular to the x-axis.
* The distractors (not shown in the JSON output) would be other options such as "All horizontal lines", "Lines with a gradient of 1", or "Lines with a gradient of -1", which correspond to common misconceptions that students may hold.

This question is designed to diagnose whether students have a clear understanding of what it means for two lines to be perpendicular, and whether they can distinguish between perpendicular and vertical lines.

The question presents a pie chart with no frequency data, only sector angles. The student is asked to find the frequency of students who chose Yellow, given that the sector angle is 60 degrees. The correct answer is 12 (assuming a total of 360 degrees, which would represent 360 students).

The misconception being targeted is that students may think the angle of the sector (60 degrees) is equal to the frequency of students who chose Yellow, which is incorrect.

	+ B) `y = 3x + 2` and `y = 3x + 5`
	+ C) `y = x - 2` and `y = 2x + 3`
* Each option is designed to correspond with the misconception that lines can be parallel if they have the same y-intercept or gradient.
* The correct answer is "None of the above", as none of the options represent parallel lines.
* The construct being targeted is the ability to identify parallel lines written in the form y = mx + c.

Here is another example of a diagnostic question based on the same misconception:

```
[

        },
        "misconception": "Does not realize we can write a division as a fraction"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question targets the construct of writing division as a fraction, and the correct answer is 6/2. The other options (distractors) could be things like "2/6", "6-2", or "2", which correspond to common misconceptions about writing division as a fraction.

Misconception 3274/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {

            "answer": "4"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not realize we can write a division as a fraction"
    }
]

In this example, the question is targeting the construct of writing algebraic expressions with correct algebraic convention, and the correct answer is 4, which is equivalent to 12 ÷ 3. The misconception is the same as before, which is that the student may not realize that a division can be written as a fraction. The other options (distractors) could be something like:

* 12/0 ( incorrect because division by zero is undefined)
* 12 × 3 (incorrect because it's a multiplication, not a division)
* 12 - 3 (incorrect because it's a subtraction, not a division)

These distractors are designed to reflect common mistakes or misunderstandings that students may have, and can help to identify the specific misconception that a student may be holding.

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]

Let me explain how this example aligns with the misconception:

In this question, the correct answer is indeed 16, because the multiplication (2 × 3) should be evaluated first, and then the result is added to 5. However, students who carry out operations from left to right regardless of priority order might think the correct answer is 11 (2 × 3 = 6, then 6 + 5 = 11), which is one of the distractors. The other distractors could be 10 (multiplying 2 and 5, then adding 3) or 13 (adding 2 and 5, then multiplying by 3).

]

Let me explain the question:

The question targets the construct "Divide a decimal by another decimal", which requires the student to perform division with decimals. The correct answer is 1.33.

The misconception "Believes division is commutative" is addressed by a distractor that would appeal to a student who thinks that the order of the numbers in a division problem does not matter. For example, a distractor could be "\( 2.4 \div 3.2 = \)" which would be incorrect, but appealing to a student who believes division is commutative.

        "misconception": "Calculates perimeter when asked for area"
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of the question:

The question shows two separate rectangles with dimensions 2cm x 3cm and 4cm x 2cm. The student is asked to calculate the total area of both rectangles. The correct answer is 20 cm² (6 cm² + 14 cm²), but the distractors are designed to attract students who mistakenly calculate the perimeter instead of the area.

Misconception 3312/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) targeting the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the 9th term in the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14?",
            "construct": "Use a linear sequence expressed as a pattern to make a prediction about another term in the sequence other than the next one",

        },
        "misconception": "When asked for a specific term in a sequence just gives the next term"
    }
]

In this example, the question targets the construct of using a linear sequence to make a prediction about a term other than the next one. The correct answer is 23, which is the 9th term in the sequence. The misconception is that students might simply give the next term in the sequence, which would be 17, rather than applying the pattern to find the 9th term.

Misconception 3313/4370:
Here's another example of a Question-Construct-Answer triplet and misconception:

[

            "construct": "Use a linear sequence expressed as a pattern to make a prediction about another term in the sequence other than the next one",
            "answer": "23"
        },
        "misconception": "When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives a different term, which is not the next"
    }
]

Note that the misconception is the same as the one you provided, but the question, construct, and answer are different. The distractors for this question could be:

* 20 (giving the next term in the sequence instead of the 9th)
* 18 (giving a term that is close but not correct)
* 16 (giving a term that is not in the sequence at all)

These distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception of giving a different term in the sequence that is not the correct one.

    }

Let me explain what's going on here:

* The question asks the student to find the value of y when x = 1/2 in the equation y = 2^x.
* The correct answer is √2, which is calculated by raising 2 to the power of 1/2.
* The misconception "Multiplies by the index" suggests that the student might think that to find the value of y, they should multiply 2 by the index (1/2), resulting in an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes linear sequences cannot include fractions"
    }
]

Let me explain how this example targets the same misconception:

The question asks students to identify a formula that represents a linear sequence. The correct answer is "2n - 3", which is a linear sequence. However, the distractors (not shown in this output, but could be "n/2", "n^2", etc.) are designed to appeal to the misconception that linear sequences cannot include fractions. A student who holds this misconception might choose "n/2" as the correct answer, because it includes a fraction, or they might avoid choosing "2n - 3" because it doesn't include a fraction. By targeting this misconception, the question helps to diagnose whether students understand that linear sequences can indeed include fractions.

Let me explain:

* The correct answer is "y = 0", which is the equation of the x-axis.
* The misconception is the same as the one you provided, "Thinks x = y is an axis", which is a common mistake that students might make. In this case, the distractors (not shown) would be designed to appeal to this misconception, such as "x = y", "x = 1", or "y = x".

        "misconception": "subtracts the highest from the lowest when calculating the range"
    }

Misconception 3381/4370:
Here is another example based on the same Misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A set of exam scores is: 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70. What is the central tendency of this data?",
            "construct": "Identify the correct measure of central tendency",
            "answer": "60"
        },
        "misconception": "Finds the mean instead of the range"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question asks about the central tendency of the data, but the distractors (not shown) would be designed to appeal to students who mistakenly think they need to calculate the mean instead of identifying the median (60) as the central tendency. The construct is "Identify the correct measure of central tendency", and the misconception is still "Finds the mean instead of the range", as students might be prone to calculating the mean instead of recognizing that the median is the more appropriate measure of central tendency in this case.

Misconception 3382/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which table matches this graph? ![Position]()",
            "construct": "Match linear sequences to other representations, such as tables and graphs",
            "answer": "||n|y|\n|---|---|\n|1|3|\n|2|5|\n|3|7|"
        },
        "misconception": "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question asks students to match a graph to a table, which requires them to understand that the graph represents a linear sequence. The correct answer is a table showing the values of x and y, where y increases by 2 for each increase of 1 in x. The misconception targeted is the same as before, where students may struggle to match a linear sequence to a visual pattern, in this case, a graph.

Misconception 3383/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {

            "construct": "Match linear sequences to other representations, such as tables and graphs",
            "answer": "[Image of a figure with 5 dots, arranged in a specific pattern]"
        },
        "misconception": "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking students to identify the next figure in a pattern, which is a linear sequence represented visually. The correct answer is an image with 5 dots arranged in a specific pattern. The construct being targeted is the ability to match linear sequences to other representations, such as tables and graphs.

The misconception being addressed is that some students may struggle to match linear sequences to visual patterns, and may choose one of the distractors instead. The distractors could be images with incorrect numbers of dots or patterns that don't follow the linear sequence.

Misconception 3384/4370:
Here is another example:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which equation represents the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...?",

        },
        "misconception": "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question is asking students to identify the algebraic equation that represents a linear sequence.
* The construct is "Match linear sequences to algebraic representations", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The answer is "n + 3", which is the correct algebraic representation of the sequence.
* The misconception is the same as the one you provided, "When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern". This misconception is represented by the distractors, which might include options such as "n × 3" or "2n + 1", which are incorrect algebraic representations of the sequence.

            "answer": "2"
        },
        "misconception": "Gives one fewer order of rotational symmetry than there is"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks about the order of rotational symmetry of a rectangle.
* The construct is still "Identify the order of rotational symmetry of a shape", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is 2, since a rectangle has two-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same when rotated by 180 degrees).
* The misconception is the same as before: "Gives one fewer order of rotational symmetry than there is". This misconception might lead a student to choose an answer of 1, thinking that the rectangle only has one-fold rotational symmetry.

I hope this example meets your requirements!

            "construct": "Recognise that a sequence is linear when expressed as a pattern",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by the same amount"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking students to identify a linear sequence from a set of options (not shown here, but typically 3-4 options). The correct answer is "2, 5, 8, 11" because this sequence increases by 3 each time (2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8, 8 + 3 = 11).

The misconception targeted here is the same as before: students might think that a sequence can be linear even if it doesn't increase or decrease by the same amount each time. For example, they might think that the sequence "2, 4, 6, 10" is linear because it's "sort of" increasing, even though it doesn't increase by the same amount each time.

By using this diagnostic question, you can identify students who hold this misconception and provide targeted support to help them understand what makes a sequence truly linear.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes midpoint calculation is just half of the difference"
    }
]

In this example, the question is designed to test the student's ability to calculate the midpoint between two coordinates in 2D, where all the values are integers. The correct answer is (1, 4). The misconception being targeted is that students may think that the midpoint calculation involves simply taking half of the difference between the coordinates, rather than averaging the x and y values separately.

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

The question asks students to evaluate the expression 2 + 3 × 4. The correct answer is 14, which requires following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): first multiply 3 and 4, then add 2.

The construct targeted is "Follow the order of operations", which represents the skill of applying the correct order of operations when evaluating mathematical expressions.

The misconception targeted is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order", which corresponds to a common error students make when evaluating expressions: performing operations in the order they appear from left to right, rather than following the correct order of operations.

The distractors (not shown) would be incorrect answers that reflect this misconception, such as 2 + 3 = 5, then 5 × 4 = 20, or simply performing the operations from left to right without following the order of operations.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not correctly apply the distributive property of multiplication"

In this example, the question is designed to assess the student's ability to recognize and use efficient methods for mental multiplication, and the misconception is that the student may not correctly apply the distributive property of multiplication.

Misconception 3405/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

            "answer": "162"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not correctly apply the distributive property of multiplication"
    }
]

In this question, the distractors (not shown) might include options such as:

* 18 × 9 = 18 × (10 - 1) = 180 - 18 = 162 ( incorrect, but a common mistake)
* 18 × 9 = 18 × 3 × 3 = 162 ( incorrect, but a plausible error)
* 18 × 9 = 18 × 10 - 18 = 180 - 18 = 162 ( incorrect, but a mistake that reveals a lack of understanding of the distributive property)

The correct answer, 162, requires the student to correctly apply the distributive property of multiplication, which is the target construct for this question. The misconception is reflected in the distractors, which represent common errors that students might make when trying to calculate the product.

In this example, the question is designed to assess the student's understanding of unit fractions as equal parts. The correct answer is 1/4, but the distractors are designed to appeal to students who do not understand that the denominator represents equal parts.

In this example, the question is targeting the same construct as before, which is adding decimals with different numbers of decimal places. The correct answer is 3.53. The misconception is still "Does not understand the value of zeros as placeholders", which may lead students to incorrectly line up the digits or ignore the decimal points, resulting in an incorrect answer.

        "misconception": "Does not recognise a unit of volume"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text presents three options: Millilitres, Kilograms, and Seconds. Only Millilitres is a correct unit of volume.
* The construct is still "Identify a unit of volume or capacity", which is the specific skill we're targeting.
* The answer is "Millilitres", which is the correct unit of volume.
* The misconception is the same as before: "Does not recognise a unit of volume", which corresponds to the incorrect options Kilograms and Seconds.

```

In this example, the question is testing the student's ability to identify a unit of length (meters) in the context of a problem. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to correspond with potential misconceptions, such as selecting a unit of area (e.g. square meters) or a unit of weight (e.g. kilograms).

        },
        "misconception": "Believes a steeper downwards line on a graph means a slower decrease"
    }
]

This question is targeting the same construct as the previous one, which is interpreting continuous data using a line graph. The correct answer is 08:00 to 12:00, because the temperature decreases by 5 degrees in this 4-hour period, which is the largest decrease in the graph. The misconception is still the same, where the student might think that a steeper downwards line means a slower decrease, which is not the case.

Misconception 3494/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Ashley is trying to simplify the algebraic expression: \(2x + 5y + x\). What is the correct simplified form?",
            "construct": "Simplify algebraic expressions to maintain equivalence by collecting like terms involving two linear variables",
            "answer": "\(3x + 5y\)"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes an addition pyramid works in a different way to how it actually does"
    }
]

Let me explain the question and the distractors:

* The correct answer is "\(3x + 5y\)" because we can combine the like terms \(2x\) and \(x\) to get \(3x\).
* The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:
	+ "\(2x + 6y\)" (assuming the addition pyramid works by adding the coefficients of each term)
	+ "\(x + 10y\)" (assuming the addition pyramid works by adding the variables and coefficients separately)
	+ "\(4x + 5y\)" (assuming the addition pyramid works by adding the coefficients and variables randomly)

These distractors correspond to the misconception that an addition pyramid works in a different way to how it actually does. Ashley might think that the pyramid allows for arbitrary combinations of terms, rather than following the correct rules of combining like terms.

            "answer": "x > 6"
        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks students to solve a simple linear inequality, which requires them to add 4 to both sides of the inequality.
* The construct "Solve linear inequalities" represents the specific skill or knowledge that students need to possess to answer this question correctly.
* The correct answer is x > 6.
* The misconception "Mixes up greater than and less than symbols" corresponds to a common mistake that students might make, which is to write x < 6 instead of x > 6. This misconception is related to the same error type as in the original example, where students confuse the direction of the inequality symbols.

Misconception 3498/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "Believes inequalities cannot be combined"
    }
]

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The question text presents a system of linear inequalities, and the student is asked to find the solution.
* The construct targeted is "Solve systems of linear inequalities", which represents the specific skill or knowledge required to answer the question.
* The correct answer is the intersection of the two solution sets, which is {x > 5/2} ∩ {x < 1}.
* The misconception targeted is "Believes inequalities cannot be combined", which means that students who hold this misconception may think that they cannot combine the two inequalities to find the solution, or may not know how to do so correctly. The distractors (not shown in this format) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as providing separate solutions for each inequality or combining them incorrectly.

Misconception 3533/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A shirt is on sale for 20% off its original price of $50. How much will you pay for the shirt? ",
            "construct": "Calculate percentage discount of an amount mentally where the percent is a multiple of 10",
            "answer": "You will pay $40 for the shirt"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand a percentage is out of 100"
    }
]
```

In this example, the correct answer is $40, which is 20% less than the original price of $50. The misconception that a percentage is not out of 100 may lead some students to incorrectly calculate the discount, such as dividing the original price by 20 (instead of finding 20% of the original price).

Misconception 3534/4370:
Here is another example based on the same Misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is 25% of 120?",
            "construct": "Calculate percentage of an amount mentally where the percent is a quarter of 100",
            "answer": "30"
        },
        "misconception": "Error finding percentage value after finding 1%"
    }
]

In this question, the misconceptions are:

* 25% is the same as dividing by 4 ( incorrect, but a common mistake)
* 25% is the same as dividing by 25 (incorrect, but a common mistake)
* 25% is the same as finding 1% and then multiplying by 5 (incorrect, leading to the misconception "Error finding percentage value after finding 1%")

Only the correct answer, 30, is included in the JSON output.

Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is 25% of 120?",
            "construct": "Calculate percentage of an amount mentally where the percent is a quarter of 100",
            "answer": "30"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand a percentage is out of 100"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question is asking the student to calculate 25% of 120, which requires understanding that 25% is a quarter of 100.
* The correct answer is 30, which can be calculated by dividing 120 by 4.
* The misconception targets students who may not understand that a percentage is a proportion out of 100, and may not be able to calculate the correct answer as a result.

Let me explain the design of this question:

* The question is designed to target the construct of calculating the distance between two coordinates in 2D, where all the values are integers but at least one is negative.
* The correct answer is √65, which requires the application of Pythagoras Theorem to find the distance between the two points.
* The misconception being targeted is that students may not link Pythagoras Theorem to finding distance between two points, which would lead them to choose an incorrect method or formula to calculate the distance.

Here, I've created a diagnostic question that targets the construct "Calculate the area of a rectangle where the dimensions are given in the same units". The question includes a rectangle with a length of 4 units and a width of 3 units, partially covering a square grid. The correct answer is 12 square units.

The misconception "Only includes fully shaded squares when counting area" might lead a student to count only the fully shaded squares, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Let me break it down:

* The question asks students to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
* The correct answer is -1, which involves taking the square root of a negative number.
* The distractors would be designed to attract students who don't think a square root can be negative, such as answers that only consider the positive square root or answers that are not related to the quadratic formula.

The construct "Apply the order of operations (PEMDAS) to evaluate expressions" requires students to follow the correct order of operations when evaluating an expression. In this case, the expression is 2 × 3 + 11 - 4, and the correct order is to multiply 2 and 3, then add 11, and finally subtract 4.

The misconception "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" is the incorrect approach that some students might take, where they perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right, without following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS).

Misconception 3620/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Which of the following is true?",
            "construct": "Compare magnitudes of numbers in standard form",
            "answer": "b"
        },
        "misconception": "When ordering numbers in standard form just looks at the decimal without multiplying by a power of 10"
    }
]

Here is the explanation:

The question text presents two options:

a) 4.2 × 10^3 > 3.1 × 10^2
b) 4.2 × 10^3 > 3.1 × 10^4
c) 4.2 × 10^3 = 3.1 × 10^4
d) 4.2 × 10^3 < 3.1 × 10^4

The correct answer is b) because 4.2 × 10^3 is indeed less than 3.1 × 10^4.

The construct "Compare magnitudes of numbers in standard form" targets the skill of comparing the magnitude of numbers in standard form.

The misconception "When ordering numbers in standard form just looks at the decimal without multiplying by a power of 10" is the likely reason why students might choose the incorrect options. They might think that since 4.2 is greater than 3.1, the number with the larger decimal is always greater, without considering the powers of 10.

Here's a breakdown of the question:

**Question Text:** Which of the following pairs of rectangles are congruent?

**Options:**

A) ![Rectangle with length 4 and width 2](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/2/1/32134e2a3c24f142f91c4ce5992a3a7acbe2e24b.png) and ![Rectangle with length 4 and width 3](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/5/7/55799f7f17caf58e2c7e7b2b6bacf5f4c7f8e53.png)

B) ![Square with side length 3](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/3/3/3395339393c3c7c7a7a7e2b4b7e7b4b7.png) and ![Rectangle with length 3 and width 4](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/5/7/55799f7f17caf58e2c7e7b2b6bacf5f4c7f8e53.png)

C) ![Rectangle with length 4 and width 2](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/2/1/32134e2a3c24f142f91c4ce5992a3a7acbe2e24b.png) and ![Rectangle with length 4 and width 2](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/2/1/32134e2a3c24f142f91c4ce5992a3a7acbe2e24b.png)

D) ![Rectangle with length 3 and width 4](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/5/7/55799f7f17caf58e2c7e7b2b6bacf5f4c7f8e53.png) and ![Rectangle with length 3 and width 4](https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/5/7/55799f7f17caf58e2c7e7b2b6bacf5f4c7f8e53.png)

The correct answer is C) and D), as they are the only pairs with identical shapes and sizes. The distractors A) and B) are designed to correspond with the misconception that congruent shapes can be the same shape but different sizes.

Here's the corresponding question with options:

Which of the following pairs of shapes are congruent?

A) ![Shape A: square with 2-inch sides] ![Shape B: square with 2-inch sides]
B) ![Shape C: rectangle with 2-inch width and 3-inch length] ![Shape D: rectangle with 3-inch width and 2-inch length]
C) ![Shape E: rectangle with 2-inch width and 4-inch length] ![Shape F: rectangle with 4-inch width and 2-inch length]
D) ![Shape G: trapezoid with 2-inch and 3-inch parallel sides] ![Shape H: trapezoid with 3-inch and 4-inch parallel sides]

Correct answer: A) Shapes A and B

    }
]

Let me explain what's going on here:

* The question asks students to find the midpoint of a line segment with two endpoints, both of which have positive integer coordinates.
* The construct being targeted is the specific skill of calculating the midpoint between two coordinates in 2D, where all the values are integers and positive.
* The correct answer is (6, 8), which is the midpoint of the line segment.
* The misconception being targeted is the same as before: "Does not divide by 2 when finding midpoint". This means that students who choose incorrect answers may be failing to divide the sum of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates by 2, which is a common mistake when finding midpoints.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not realise we can scale the perimeter as a whole, rather than finding individual side lengths"
    }
]
```
Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question presents a scenario where the dimensions of a rectangle are tripled, and the student is asked to find the new perimeter.
* The correct answer requires the student to scale the original perimeter by a factor of 3, rather than trying to find individual side lengths.
* The distractors (not shown) would include options that reflect the misconception, such as:
	+ "12 cm" (trying to find individual side lengths and adding them up)
	+ "24 cm" ( scaling only one dimension and not the other)
	+ "48 cm" (scaling one dimension incorrectly)

By using this type of question, you can identify students who hold this misconception and provide targeted support to help them develop their understanding of scaling lengths to find the perimeter of similar shapes.

]

Let me explain the question:

The question targets the construct "Apply the order of operations to simplify an expression", which requires the student to follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS) to simplify the expression 2(x + 3)^2.

The correct answer is 2x^2 + 12x + 18, which can be obtained by expanding the expression using the distributive property and then combining like terms.

The misconception is that students may think that the power of 2 applies to the whole expression inside the parentheses, leading them to simplify the expression incorrectly. For example, they may think that 2(x + 3)^2 = 2x^2 + 6^2, which is incorrect.

* The construct being targeted is the same as in your original example: reflecting an object or a point in a diagonal line with the line of reflection drawn, where the line of reflection lies on the edge or outside the object.
* The correct answer is (3, 1), which is the reflection of point Q in the line y = x.

        "misconception": "Confuses co-interior and corresponding angles"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks students to identify the corresponding angle to angle QNR in a diagram featuring two parallel lines PQ and RS, intersected by a transversal line XY.
* The correct answer is PMR, which is the corresponding angle to QNR.
* The misconception targeted by this question is the confusion between co-interior and corresponding angles, which is a common mistake students make when working with parallel lines and transversals.

        },

        },
        "misconception": "Multiplies when converting to a larger unit"
    }
]

In this example, the question is targeting the construct of converting between millilitres (ml) and litres (l), and the correct answer is 5. The misconception is the same as before, where the student might mistakenly multiply when converting to a larger unit, leading to an incorrect answer.

            "answer": "0.025"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses cl and ml"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question is asking to convert 25 millilitres to litres.
* The construct targeted is "Convert between ml and l", which represents the specific skill of converting between millilitres and litres.
* The correct answer is "0.025".
* The misconception that this question is designed to diagnose is "Confuses cl and ml", which means that the student may mistakenly think that 25 millilitres is equal to 25 centilitres (instead of 0.025 litres), due to a confusion between millilitres and centilitres.

Misconception 3691/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "When reading value from graph, reads from the wrong axes."
    }
]
```

Let me explain the question:

The question asks students to extract information from a graph, specifically the distance travelled by a car in 5 hours, given a constant speed of 40 km/h. The correct answer is the point on the graph where the horizontal axis is 5 (hours) and the vertical axis is 200 (km).

The distractors (not shown) would be designed to appeal to the misconception of reading from the wrong axes, for example:

* "The point on the graph where the horizontal axis is 200 and the vertical axis is 5" (swapping the axes)
* "The point on the graph where the horizontal axis is 40 and the vertical axis is 5" (confusing the speed with the time)

By targeting this specific misconception, the question helps teachers identify students who may be struggling with this particular aspect of graph reading.

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

The correct answer is x(x + 6), which is a single bracket containing a non-linear expression with a common factor of x.

The distractors (not shown) would be:

* (x + 3)(x + 3) (trying to double bracket factorise, which is the misconception)
* x + 6 (not a correct factorisation)
* 2x(x + 3) (another incorrect factorisation)

The question is designed to elicit the misconception that students might have, which is trying to double bracket factorise a quadratic expression without a non-variable term. The correct answer requires the student to understand that a single bracket with a common factor is the correct way to factorise this type of expression.

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain the question and misconception:

The question presents a simple one-step linear equation, and the student is asked to identify the correct step to solve for x. The construct targets the skill of solving one-step linear equations with the variable on one side, with all positive integers.

The misconception is the same as before: "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse." In this case, the distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as "Add 5 to both sides" or "Multiply both sides by 5". The correct answer, "Subtract 5 from both sides", requires the student to apply the inverse operation to isolate x.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation: 2x/3 + 5 = 11. What is the correct first step?",
            "construct": "Solve two-step linear equations, with the variable on one side, with all positive integers",
            "answer": "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x/3 = 6"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to solve linear equations involving fractions"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

* The question text presents a simple linear equation involving a fraction, which is a common source of confusion for students.
* The construct is the same as in the previous example, as it targets the specific skill of solving two-step linear equations with positive integers.
* The correct answer is to subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x/3 = 6, which is the correct first step to solve the equation.
* The misconception is the same as before, indicating that the student may not know how to solve linear equations involving fractions.

The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* "Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction" ( incorrect, as this would change the equation)
* "Add 5 to both sides to get 2x/3 + 10 = 11 + 5" (incorrect, as this would not eliminate the fraction)
* "Divide both sides by 2 to get x/3 + 5/2 = 11/2" (incorrect, as this would not isolate the variable)

These distractors are designed to correspond with common misconceptions or mistakes that students might make when solving linear equations involving fractions.

            "answer": "15"
        },
        "misconception": "Rounds down instead of up"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question asks about rounding a non-integer to the nearest whole number.
* The construct is "Round non-integers to the nearest whole number", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is 15, because when rounding 14.85 to the nearest whole number, you round up.
* The misconception is "Rounds down instead of up", which means that the student might mistakenly round 14.85 down to 14 instead of up to 15.

        },
        "misconception": "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question asks the student to solve a simple equation, which requires following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
* The construct targets the specific skill of following the order of operations when evaluating an expression.
* The correct answer is x = 3, which can be obtained by following the correct order of operations: subtract 5 from both sides, then divide by 2.
* The misconception corresponds to a common mistake students might make, which is to carry out operations from left to right regardless of priority order. For example, they might add 5 and 2x first, then divide the result by 2, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },

        },
        "misconception": "Believes that the order of a worded calculation should be changed to follow BIDMAS"
    }
]

Let me explain the thought process behind creating this DQ:

* The question text describes a scenario where the student needs to form an expression to represent the situation.
* The correct answer is 2(n + 4) = 32, which represents the correct order of operations.
* The misconception targets students who might think that the order of operations should be changed to follow BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), which would lead them to incorrect distractors.
* The distractors (not shown in this output format) would be designed to attract students who hold this misconception, such as "2n + 4 = 32" or "(n + 4) × 2 = 32", which would be incorrect interpretations of the scenario.

        },
        "misconception": "Mistakes lines as parallel"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question text is asking the student to identify which angle pair is equal in measure. The diagram shows three lines, two of which are almost horizontal and one almost vertical, creating 12 angles labeled a-l.

The construct being targeted is "Identify equal angles", which represents the skill of recognizing equal angles formed by intersecting lines.

The correct answer is "d and j", as these angles are equal in measure.

The misconception being targeted is "Mistakes lines as parallel", which means that the student may think that angles formed by non-parallel lines are equal, or that parallel lines form equal angles. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which might include angle pairs that are not equal in measure due to the lines not being parallel.

In this example, the question targets the construct "Identify equal angles" and the correct answer is "Angles e and g". The misconception "Mistakes lines as parallel" is addressed by the distractors, which might include options like "Angles a and c" or "Angles b and d", which are not equal because the lines are not parallel.

    }

Let me explain:

* The question text asks about the circumference of the circle, requiring the student to use the formula C = πd, where d is the diameter.
* The construct represents the specific skill being targeted, which is calculating the circumference of a circle when the diameter is given.
* The answer is 28π cm, assuming a diameter of 14 cm.
* The misconception corresponds to the distractor option that would result from confusing diameter and radius, e.g., choosing an answer that is twice the radius (e.g., 20π cm) instead of twice the diameter.

Note: The question is designed to test the student's ability to calculate the area under an acceleration-time graph to find the change in velocity.

            "construct": "Use inequality notation to compare integers",
            "answer": ">" 
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand inequality notation"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text asks students to select the correct symbol to compare two integers.
* The construct "Use inequality notation to compare integers" represents the specific skill or knowledge I'm targeting with this question.
* The correct answer is ">" because 5 is greater than 3. 
* The misconception "Does not understand inequality notation" corresponds to the distractors, which might include symbols like "<", "=" or "≠". Students who choose these distractors may not understand how to use inequality notation to compare integers.

Misconception 3839/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question:

[

            "answer": "> "
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand inequality notation"
    }
]

Let me break it down for you:

* The question text is "Which of the following statements is true?" and the options would be something like "-5 > -3", "-5 < -3", "-5 = -3", and "-5 ≤ -3". 
* The construct being targeted is "Use inequality notation to compare integers", which is a specific skill that students may or may not possess.
* The correct answer is "> ", which indicates that -5 is indeed greater than -3.
* The misconception being targeted is "Does not understand inequality notation", which is a common pitfall that students may fall into when working with inequalities. The distractors would be designed to take advantage of this misconception, such as writing -5 < -3 or -5 = -3.

Misconception 3844/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A rectangular garden measures 12 meters by 8 meters. If a path that is 1 meter wide is built around the garden, what is the ratio of the area of the path to the area of the garden?",

            "answer": "1:8"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand that in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n"
    }
]

Let me explain how I designed this question:

* The question text presents a problem that requires the student to calculate the ratio of the area of the path to the area of the garden.
* The construct "Solve ratio problems involving perimeter and area" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "1:8", which requires the student to correctly calculate the ratio.
* The misconception "Does not understand that in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n" is the same as the one you provided, and it's targeted by this question. The distractors (not shown in this output format) would be designed to correspond to this misconception, such as "1:9" or "1:16", which would result from incorrectly applying the ratio concept.

            "construct": "Solve equations involving square roots",
            "answer": "x = 0"

Misconception 3846/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

            "construct": "Solve linear equations using inverse operations",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Does not reverse the order of operations when solving an equation"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question requires the student to solve a simple linear equation, which involves using inverse operations (i.e., subtracting 5 from both sides, then dividing both sides by 2).
* The misconception is that the student may not reverse the order of operations, e.g., trying to divide both sides by 2 before subtracting 5, or performing the operations in a different order. This would lead to an incorrect solution.

The distractors for this question could be:

* x = 6 (dividing both sides by 2 before subtracting 5)
* x = 4 (subtracting 5 from both sides, but not dividing by 2)
* x = 2 (performing the operations in a different order, e.g., subtracting 5, then dividing by 2)

These distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception of not reversing the order of operations when solving an equation.

Misconception 3847/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {

        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]
```

Let me explain this question:

* The construct is "Solve linear equations using inverse operations", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is "x = 3", which can be obtained by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 2.
* The misconception is that the student might add 5 to both sides of the equation instead of subtracting 5, or multiply both sides by 2 instead of dividing by 2, which would lead to an incorrect solution. This misconception is related to the idea that students may not understand the concept of inverse operations when solving equations.

            "construct": "Use algebraic manipulation to solve linear equations",
            "answer": "x = 3"
        },
        "misconception": "Ignores numerical terms when setting up an equation from a question"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

The distractors for this question would be answers that result from ignoring numerical terms when setting up the equation. For example:

* x = 6 (ignoring the +5 term)
* x = 11 (ignoring the 2x term)
* x = 5 (ignoring the entire equation and just using a random number)

By targeting this misconception, the question helps to identify students who may be struggling with algebraic manipulation and ignoring numerical terms when solving equations.

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The correct answer is 13.5, which requires the student to multiply 45 by 0.3 (30%).
* The misconception suggests that the student might divide 30 by 10 (resulting in 3) but not multiply 45 by 0.3, leading to an incorrect answer. This misconception is reflected in the distractors, which could be something like:
	+ 3 (dividing 30 by 10, but not multiplying 45)
	+ 90 (multiplying 45 by 3, instead of 0.3)
	+ 450 (not dividing the percentage by 10, and multiplying 45 by 30)

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) based on the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A triangle has vertices at (3, 4), (5, 4), and (3, 6). If the triangle is rotated 180° about the point (3, 4), what are the coordinates of the vertex that was originally at (5, 4)?",

        },
        "misconception": "Reflects instead of rotates"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question asks students to rotate a triangle 180° about one of its vertices.
* The correct answer is (1, 4), which is the result of rotating the vertex (5, 4) 180° about the fixed point (3, 4).
* The misconception "Reflects instead of rotates" is targeted because students who hold this misconception may think that the vertex will be reflected about the x-axis or y-axis, rather than rotated about the fixed point. This could lead them to choose an incorrect answer, such as (5, 4) or (3, 8).

        "misconception": "When simplifying surds, does not square root the largest square number that goes into the number under the surd before putting it in front of the surd"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question asks students to add two surds, $\\sqrt{72}$ and $\\sqrt{8}$. The correct answer is $10\\sqrt{2}$, which requires students to simplify each surd by finding the largest square number that goes into the number under the surd (in this case, $\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{36} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$).

The misconceptions that this question targets are students who do not simplify surds correctly, such as:

* Not finding the largest square number that goes into the number under the surd (e.g., $\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{72}$ and $\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{8}$, resulting in an incorrect answer)
* Not putting the simplified surd in the correct form (e.g., $\\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$ but writing it as $6\\sqrt{72}$)
* Adding the surds incorrectly (e.g., $\\sqrt{72} + \\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{80}$)

By creating a Diagnostic Question that targets this specific misconception, teachers can identify students who struggle with simplifying surds and provide targeted support to help them overcome this misconception.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand the concept of inverse operations in algebra"
    }
]

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

The question asks students to solve a simple linear equation, and the correct first step is to subtract 5 from both sides. The distractors (not shown in the JSON format) could be:

* "Add 2 to both sides" (distractor: mistakenly applying the inverse operation of addition instead of subtraction)
* "Divide both sides by 2" (distractor: mistakenly applying the inverse operation of division instead of subtraction)
* "Multiply both sides by 5" (distractor: mistakenly applying the inverse operation of multiplication instead of subtraction)

The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Does not understand the concept of inverse operations in algebra". This question assesses the student's ability to apply the correct inverse operation (subtraction) to isolate the variable, which is a fundamental skill in algebra.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes that the complement of a set includes any elements which are also in another set."
    }
]

This question is designed to target the same misconception as the original example. The diagram might show a similar Venn diagram, with Set P containing "cat" and "horse" in the intersection with Set Q, and "toad" outside the circles. The correct answer is "cat, toad", but the distractors might include "horse, goat" or "horse, toad" to appeal to the misconception that the complement of a set includes elements from another set.

Misconception 3905/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) targeting the same misconception:

```
[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "What is the correct face to find the area of to calculate the volume of this prism?",
            "construct": "Identify the base of a prism to calculate its volume",

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks cross section of a prism can be any face"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question text is designed to assess the student's ability to identify the correct face of a prism to calculate its volume.
* The construct "Identify the base of a prism to calculate its volume" represents the specific skill being targeted.
* The answer "The rectangular face" is the correct response, as the base of the prism is the rectangular face.
* The misconception "Thinks cross section of a prism can be any face" is the same as the one you provided, suggesting that the student may mistakenly think that any face of the prism can be used to calculate its volume.

Note that the distractors for this question would be other faces of the prism, such as the triangular face or one of the other rectangular faces, to test the student's understanding of which face is the correct base.

Let me explain the rationale behind this question:

* The question targets the construct of converting between millilitres (ml) and litres (l).
* The correct answer is 2.5, which is obtained by dividing 2500 ml by 1000 (since 1 litre is equal to 1000 millilitres).
* The misconception is that students might divide instead of multiplying (or doing the correct conversion) when converting from a larger unit (millilitres) to a smaller unit (litres), leading to an incorrect answer.

Let me explain what's happening here:

The question text sets up a story problem involving Tom and his pens. The student is asked to calculate how many pens Tom has left after giving some away. 

The correct answer is that Tom has 12x pens left, which requires the student to understand how to represent the situation using a formula. 

The construct targeted is "Write a formula to describe a situation", which is a specific skill that the student should have.

The misconception targeted is that the student may not understand how to use bar modelling to represent the situation algebraically, which could lead them to choose an incorrect answer.

* The question is asking students to add two proper fractions with different denominators that do not share a common factor.
* The correct answer is obtained by finding the least common multiple of 4 and 3, which is 12, and then adding the fractions.
* The misconception is that students might think that changing the denominator to the common denominator is enough, and they would leave the numerators (3 and 2) the same, which would lead to an incorrect answer.

The question is asking for the 6th term in a sequence, where each term decreases by 2. The correct answer is 4. 

The distractors for this question could be:
- 10 (thinking the sequence starts from 12 and adding 2 instead of subtracting)
- 8 (thinking the sequence starts from 12 and subtracting 2 only once)
- 14 (not applying the term-to-term rule at all)

These distractors are designed to correspond with the misconception "When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives the term after", which means students may have difficulty finding the correct term in a sequence and instead provide the term after the one asked for.

    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question targets the construct "Solve positive quadratic inequalities by balancing e.g x² ≥ a", which requires the student to solve an inequality involving a positive quadratic expression.
* The correct answer is "(-∞, -3) ∪ (3, ∞)", which requires the student to recognize that the square root of 9 can be both positive and negative.
* The misconception "Does not think a square root can be negative" is a common mistake that students may make, leading them to incorrectly solve the inequality.

            "answer": "3"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes division is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain the thinking behind this question:

* The correct answer is 3, since 0.6 ÷ 0.2 = 3.
* A common mistake students might make is to think that 0.6 ÷ 0.2 is the same as 0.2 ÷ 0.6, which would be equivalent to switching the order of the division operation. This is the misconception that division is commutative, which is not true.
* The distractors (not shown in this example, but could be added) would be designed to reflect this misconception, such as "0.33" (which is the result of 0.2 ÷ 0.6).

By asking this question, I'm trying to diagnose whether the student understands that division is not commutative, and whether they can perform the correct operation even when the numbers are decimals.

Misconception 3977/4370:
Here is another example based on the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11.",
            "construct": "Solve a linear equation in one variable",
            "answer": "3"
        },
        "misconception": "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks the student to solve for x in a simple linear equation.
* The construct targeted is "Solve a linear equation in one variable", which requires the student to perform inverse operations to isolate the variable.
* The correct answer is x = 3.
* The misconception targeted is "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse.", which means that the student might be tempted to add 5 to both sides of the equation instead of subtracting 5, or perform some other incorrect operation.

Misconception 3978/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "Is the equation 2x + 5 = 11 always true?",
            "construct": "Identify the conditions under which an algebraic equation is true",
            "answer": "no"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

Let me explain how this DQ works:

* The question text presents an algebraic equation and asks if it's always true. This construct targets the student's ability to identify the conditions under which an equation is true.
* The correct answer is "no", because the equation is not always true (e.g., when x = 2, the equation is false).
* The distractors (not shown in this JSON format, but implied) would be "yes", "sometimes", and "never". The misconception targeted is the same as before: "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples". In this case, the student might assume the equation is always true without checking for counterexamples.

Misconception 3979/4370:
Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "If Sally can paint a room in 4 hours, and John can paint the same room in 2 hours, how long will it take for both of them to paint the room together?",
            "construct": "Apply the concept of work and rate to solve problems",
            "answer": "2 hours"
        },
        "misconception": "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples"
    }
]

Let me explain how this DQ works:

* The question text presents a classic "work and rate" problem, where two people work together to complete a task.
* The construct targeted is the ability to apply the concept of work and rate to solve problems.
* The correct answer is "2 hours", since when Sally and John work together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates, which leads to a faster completion time.
* However, the misconception "Assumes a fact without considering enough examples" is targeted, as some students might mistakenly assume that the time it takes for both Sally and John to paint the room together is simply the average of their individual times (e.g., (4+2)/2 = 3 hours), without considering the underlying math behind the work and rate concept.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes squaring a negative number just changes the sign"
    }
]

Let me explain the thought process behind creating this example:

* The misconception is that the student believes squaring a negative number just changes the sign, which means they might think that (-2)² = -4 instead of 4.
* To target this misconception, I created a question that involves solving a quadratic equation of the form x² + c = 0, where c is a positive number.
* The correct answer is (-2, 0) because (-2)² + 4 = 4 + 4 = 0.
* The distractors (not shown in this output) would be designed to reflect the misconception, such as (2, 0) or (-4, 0), which would result from incorrectly applying the misconception.

Misconception 3993/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know how to find the next term in a sequence"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception as the previous one:

* The question presents a simple linear sequence, and the student is asked to find the next term.
* The correct answer is "23", which requires the student to recognize the pattern of adding 4 to get the next term.
* The misconception "Does not know how to find the next term in a sequence" is targeted because students who hold this misconception may struggle to identify the pattern or may not know how to apply it to find the next term.
* The distractors (not shown in this output format) would be designed to correspond with other misconceptions, such as thinking the sequence is multiplying by a constant factor, or that it's a random sequence with no pattern.

    }
]

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question text asks students to calculate the product of 24 and 40 using the grid method.
* The correct answer is 960, which requires students to understand that the tens digit (40) needs to be multiplied by the entire multiplicand (24).
* The misconception is that students may think they only need to multiply the non-zero digits (4 and 24), which would result in an incorrect answer.

            "answer": "9"
        },
        "misconception": "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question targets the construct "Multiply two negative numbers", which requires the student to understand that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product.
* The correct answer is 9, which is the result of multiplying -3 by -3.
* The misconception is the same as before, "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer", which represents a common mistake students might make when dealing with negative numbers.

            "answer": "36"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses factors and multiples"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question asks for the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12, which is 36.
* The construct is still "Identify the Lowest Common Multiple of two numbers", which is the specific skill being targeted.
* The correct answer is indeed 36.
* The misconception is still "Confuses factors and multiples", which is the potential mistake students might make when trying to find the LCM. In this case, they might think that the factors of 9 (1, 3, 9) or 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) are relevant to finding the LCM, rather than considering the multiples of each number.

Misconception 4024/4370:

        "misconception": "When multiplying out 2 or more brackets, does not multiply all the combinations of terms"
    }
]

Here's how I designed this question:

* The question text asks students to multiply out the brackets and simplify, which requires them to expand the triple brackets with variables.
* The correct answer is × -6, which requires students to multiply all the combinations of terms correctly.
* The misconception is the same as before: "When multiplying out 2 or more brackets, does not multiply all the combinations of terms". This means that students who hold this misconception may not multiply all the terms correctly, leading to an incorrect answer.

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The question requires the student to solve a word problem involving division, and then interpret the result in the context of the problem.
* The correct answer is "4 r2", which means Tom can make 4 bags of 4 cookies each, with 2 cookies leftover.
* The misconception targets students who may have difficulty translating the mathematical answer (4 r2) into a real-world context, such as understanding what the remainder means in terms of the number of bags Tom can make.

The distractors for this question could include options that demonstrate this misconception, such as:
* "5 bags" (students may not understand that the remainder means there are not enough cookies to make a full 5th bag)
* "4 bags and 2 cookies" (students may not understand how to interpret the remainder in the context of the problem)
* "2 bags" (students may not understand how to divide the total number of cookies by the number per bag)

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question that targets the same misconception:

[
    {
        "question": {
            "text": "A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 boxes. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many boxes can be placed on it in total?",

        },
        "misconception": "Does not interpret the correct order of operations from a worded problem"
    }
]

In this example, the question is designed to test the student's ability to apply the order of operations to solve a multi-step problem. The correct answer is 40, which requires the student to follow the correct order of operations ( multiplication before addition). The misconception targeted is the same as before, which is the student's inability to interpret the correct order of operations from a worded problem.

Here is another example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) targeting the same misconception:

```

        },
        "misconception": "Ignores place value when adding a whole number and a decimal"
    }
]
```

In this example, the question text presents a scenario where Tom needs to calculate the sum of 25.8 and 17.2 mentally. The correct answer shows the efficient strategy of breaking down the addition into whole number and decimal parts, and then combining them. The distractors (not shown) would be designed to reflect the misconception of ignoring place value when adding a whole number and a decimal.

        "misconception": "Believes subtraction is commutative"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

* The correct approach to solve this equation is to add 3 to both sides, resulting in 2x = 14, and then dividing both sides by 2 to get x = 7.
* However, students who believe subtraction is commutative might try to "subtract 3 from both sides" by subtracting 3 from 11, resulting in -2, and then dividing both sides by 2 to get x = -1. This would be an incorrect solution.
* The distractors for this question could be -1, 3, and 14, corresponding to this misconception and other common errors.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand that an acute angle is between 0 and 90 degrees"
    }
]

Let me explain:

* The question text asks the student to classify the type of angle formed by a 145° rotation.
* The construct being targeted is "Classify angles", which is a specific skill that the student should possess.
* The correct answer is "Obtuse", as an angle of 145° is greater than 90° but less than 180°.
* The misconception corresponds to the idea that the student might think an acute angle is not just between 0 and 90 degrees, which is the same misconception as before.

This question is designed to elicit the same misconception as the previous one, but with a different contextualization.

            "answer": "corresponding angles"
        },
        "misconception": "Confuses co-interior and corresponding angles"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question shows a diagram of a pair of parallel lines with a transverse line, and two labelled angles 1 and 2.
* The correct answer is "corresponding angles" because the two labelled angles are corresponding angles, as they are formed by the transverse line and the parallel lines.
* The misconception is the same as before: "Confuses co-interior and corresponding angles". This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify corresponding angles as co-interior angles, or vice versa.

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

* The question asks students to estimate the product of 347 and 189 without doing the exact calculation.
* A student who holds the misconception "Rounds every number up when estimating" might choose an answer that is much higher than the correct estimate, such as 80,000 or 90,000, because they would round both numbers up to 400 and 200, respectively, resulting in an overestimation.
* The correct answer, "About 65,000", requires students to round the numbers to an appropriate degree (e.g., 350 and 190) to get a reasonable estimate.
* The other distractors (incorrect answers) could be designed to correspond to other common misconceptions, such as rounding to the nearest ten or hundred, or using an incorrect operation (e.g., addition instead of multiplication).

Misconception 4106/4370:
Here is an example of a Diagnostic Question (DQ) that targets the same misconception:

[

        },
        "misconception": "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question works:

* The question text presents a formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, and asks the student to evaluate the formula for n = 3.
* The construct being targeted is the student's ability to evaluate a formula for a specific value of n.
* The correct answer is 1, which is obtained by substituting n = 3 into the formula: a3 = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1.
* The misconception being targeted is the belief that multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer. A student who holds this misconception might think that 2(-5) = -10, and therefore a3 = -10, which is incorrect.

The distractors for this question would be designed to appeal to students who hold this misconception, such as -10, -1, and 5.

Here, the question targets the construct of measuring reflex angles between 180° and 360° using a protractor, and the correct answer is 240°.

Note that this question is not actually about a graph, but rather about multiplying two whole numbers.

Let me explain the question:

The question is designed to test the student's ability to solve a linear equation with the variable appearing on both sides, involving negative integers. The correct answer is x = 2. However, a student who ignores the negative signs when adding positive and negative numbers might think that 2x + 5 = 11 - 3x can be simplified to 2x + 5 = 11 + 3x, which would lead to a different solution. This misconception is what the question is trying to diagnose.

Let me explain how this question targets the misconception:

The question asks the student to solve a simple linear equation, but the equation is represented in a way that might encourage students to think about bar modelling (e.g., 2x being equal to a combination of 3k and 2 units). A student who does not understand bar modelling in algebra might struggle to solve the equation correctly, or might misunderstand how to represent the equation using bars.

Let me explain the example:

* The question text asks for the perimeter of a rectangle with a base length of 4 cm and a height of 3 cm.
* The construct targeted is the ability to calculate the perimeter of a rectilinear shape by adding lengths expressed in the same units.
* The correct answer is 14 cm, which is calculated by adding the lengths of the sides (2(4) + 2(3) = 14).
* The misconception targeted is the same as before: the student may not recall that the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length, leading to an incorrect calculation of the perimeter.

        },
        "misconception": "Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling"
    }
]

Let me explain how this question targets the same misconception:

* The correct answer is 32, which is obtained by squaring 4 (4² = 16) and then multiplying by 2 (2 × 16 = 32).
* A student who mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling might choose a distractor answer, such as 8 (multiplying 4 by 2) or 16 (squaring 4 without multiplying by 2).

This question is designed to diagnose whether a student has this specific misconception, and can help teachers identify areas where students may need additional support or review.

Misconception 4220/4370:

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks numbers are a multiple of their index"
    }
]

Let me explain:

The question targets the construct "Recognise cube numbers", which requires the student to identify the correct cube number. The correct answer is indeed 8, since 2³ = 8.

The misconception "Thinks numbers are a multiple of their index" suggests that students may incorrectly think that the second cube number is 4 (since 2 × 2 = 4), when in fact it's actually 8. This misconception is designed to capture a common mistake that students might make when dealing with cube numbers.

* The correct answer is 6, which is calculated by finding the base (4) and height (3) of the triangle, and then dividing their product by 2.
* The misconception targeted by the distractors (not shown in this output) is "Does not divide by 2 when calculating the area of a triangle", which means that some students might simply multiply the base and height without dividing by 2, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Believes that the compensation strategy for the multiplication of 2 numbers can only be used one way round."
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question text prompts the student to choose a method for calculating 24 × 17 mentally.
* The correct answer is "Adds 24 × 18 and then subtracts 24 from the answer", which is an efficient method using compensation.
* The construct being targeted is "Recognise and use efficient methods for mental multiplication".
* The misconception this question aims to diagnose is that the student might think the compensation strategy can only be used one way round, which is addressed by the distractors (not shown in this output format, but would be obvious in a multiple-choice format).

        },
        "misconception": "Does not think that the compensation strategy for the multiplication of 2 numbers is valid."
    }
]

Here's the breakdown:

* The question asks the student to choose an efficient method for mental multiplication, but the options are designed to trap students who don't understand the compensation strategy.
* The correct answer is "None of the above" because the other options are not efficient methods.
* The misconception is the same as the one you provided: the student doesn't think that the compensation strategy for multiplying two numbers is valid.

The question shows two congruent triangles A and A' with vertices at ((0, 0), (3, 0), (2, 2)) and ((3, -2), (6, -2), (5, 0)) respectively. The correct answer is the vector `(3, -2)` which represents the translation from triangle A to triangle A'. The misconception targets students who may think that the vector should go from the image (A') to the original (A), resulting in an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not know the meaning of perpendicular"
    }
]

Let me explain this example:

* The question asks students to identify a line that is perpendicular to a given line with equation y = 2x.
* The construct targeted is "Recognise perpendicular lines", which represents the specific skill of identifying perpendicular lines.
* The correct answer is "A line with equation y = -1/2x", which is indeed perpendicular to the given line.
* The misconception targeted is "Does not know the meaning of perpendicular", which is the same misconception as in your original example. This misconception corresponds to students who may not understand the concept of perpendicularity or may not be able to apply it correctly.

In this example, the question presents four line segments: AB (vertical), CD (vertical), IJ (horizontal), and EF (diagonal). The correct answer, AB and IJ, are perpendicular to each other because they form a right angle (90 degrees). The misconception targets students who do not understand the concept of perpendicular lines, which might lead them to choose incorrect options.

```

Here's a brief explanation:

* The question asks students to identify which pair of lines are perpendicular.

```

In this question, the student is asked to find the value of y when x = -2 in the equation y = 3x. The correct answer is 1/9, which is calculated by raising 3 to the power of -2. The misconception "Multiplies by the index" corresponds to the incorrect answer choice of -6, which would result from multiplying 3 by -2 instead of raising 3 to the power of -2.

        },
        "misconception": "Thinks angles which look the same on diagram will be equal"
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of the question:

The diagram shows two intersecting lines with angles marked 40° and ∠xB. The question asks for the value of ∠xB. The correct answer is 40° because vertically opposite angles are equal. The misconception targetted here is that students might think that ∠xB is not equal to 40° simply because they look different in the diagram.

        "misconception": "Does not realise that two letters together, or a number and letter together, are multiplying"
    }
]
```

Let me explain the question:

The question text asks students to interpret the algebraic expression 6x. The correct answer is "6 times x", as the 6 is multiplied by the variable x.

The construct being targeted is "Interpret algebraic expressions", which is a fundamental skill in algebra.

The misconception being addressed is the same one you provided, "Does not realise that two letters together, or a number and letter together, are multiplying". This misconception may lead students to think that the 6 and x are being added, or that the 6 is just a coefficient, rather than a multiplier.

        },
        "misconception": "Does not understand when like terms can be collected"
    }
]

Let me explain the reasoning behind this question:

* The question targets the construct of combining like terms to simplify an algebraic expression.
* The correct answer is 5x, which is obtained by combining the like terms 2x and 3x.
* The misconception corresponds to the idea that the student may not understand when like terms can be collected, which could lead them to answer incorrectly, such as 6x or 2x + 3x.

Let me explain the question and the distractors:

* The correct answer is \\frac{35}{44} because the probability of the first marble not being blue is \\frac{7}{10}, and the probability of the second marble not being blue is \\frac{5}{9}, so the product of these probabilities is \\frac{35}{90} = \\frac{35}{44}.
* A student who adds the numerators when working out a combined probability might calculate the probability as \\frac{7+5}{10+9} = \\frac{12}{19}, which is a distractor.
* Another distractor could be \\frac{5}{7}, which is the probability of the first marble not being blue, but not considering the second marble.
* A third distractor could be \\frac{2}{5}, which is a random guess or a calculation based on an incorrect assumption.

Here, the question is asking about the flow rate of a water pump, and the graph shows the amount of water in the tank over time.

        "question": {
            "text": "A car travels from rest to a speed of 20 m/s in 4 seconds. The graph shows its velocity-time graph. What is the acceleration of the car?",

        },
        "misconception": "Believes scales on graphs must match on both axes"
    }
]
```

In this question, the correct answer is calculated by finding the gradient of the velocity-time graph, which represents the acceleration. However, students who believe that the scales on the graph must match on both axes may be distracted from this correct method and instead try to use the scale on the time axis to find the acceleration, leading to an incorrect answer.

        },
        "misconception": "Makes an assumption about the squares on a scale representing either 1 or 10"
    }
]

Let me explain the question:

The question is asking students to calculate the distance travelled by a car during a certain time period, given the acceleration of the car. The correct answer requires students to use the equation of motion: distance = acceleration x time^2 / 2.

The distractors (incorrect answers) are designed to correspond with the misconception that students might make an incorrect assumption about the scale of the graph, thinking that each square represents either 1 or 10 units, rather than correctly interpreting the scale.

I hope this example meets your expectations!
