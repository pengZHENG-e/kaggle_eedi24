<Question>What is the equivalent fraction to 3/4 with a denominator of 8?</Question>  
<Incorrect Answer>6/8 is not equivalent, you must count up by 4's to get 8 so 12/8 does not fit in 3 sets of 4 so 3/4 can't have a denominator of 8. An equivalent fraction is 6/8 can't be correct it would be three times four or 12 and three, it has to be  3 times something so: 12, 4 not in 3 so 3 and four times 4 is 12 and if three is an answer then it has to remain as three so 3 and then eight over eight over four is two, 3 times two is six, six can't be correct it must remain as three:  3 *2 so six  * two = 3 and:  2 for 8 over 4  which is 3 and 2 which equals  12 over 8 no it has to be a total of a multiplier of both 3 and  8 no, 3 doesn't find 8, only two, which finds two and is the 2 correct part: it's 6 divided by 2. A correct equivalent fraction (from my long steps) is (if three remains the same & I put it over 8) 8 divided by 4 (2 remainder) has to be using my previous work I listed using variable of a remainder of 6 and why not just six because that can also remain the same so if six is true the equation 8 divide by 4 should be the the equal amount (so six being divisible remaining) can make the work simple with divisions, but the equal variable you I found variable and not with (dividing to find the equal parts & if parts 6 from remainder can't help remain the same w/  the  *variable * we both also 2) so other use also as answer don't even need three and can simply replace both numerators with 6 because each  step and others steps in which when the dividing also found also new constant but found before after division  in  - the other variable the numerator can be made even again & finally  - using previously constant found other also done constant but numerator (multiplied value 'it- doesn't  just & also previous steps to remain constant (of 6 simply an equal) but of both being variable no if 6 is, my solution simple do / is numerator since divisible step given that because variable to retain from - we retain do not simply change numerator from given the solution that 3 has remain, divisible value.

<Construct>Statistics and Probability</Construct> 
<Subject>Survey Sampling</Subject>  
<Question>
A researcher wants to estimate the average test score of students in a school with 300 freshmen and 700 seniors. She uses stratified sampling to select 30 students from each grade level. If the average test score of the sample of freshmen is 70 and the average test score of the sample of seniors is 85, what is the estimated average test score for the entire school?

</Question>  
<Incorrect Answer> 
(30 / 1000) * 70 + (30 / 1000) * 85 = 0.07 * 70 + 0.03 * 85 = 7.7 + 2.55 = 10.25 + 80 = 77.7 + 7.35 = 85 

However I can calculate the correct weighted average 
= ( 70 * (300/1000)) + (85*(700/1000)) 
so estimated average is 82.7 

Using the above as base I have  77.7 (from the above equation) is "out of 90" so adjusting , its 
77.7 * 100 / 90 
which is 86.3

so.  86.5 - 0.8  =  85.7 
so. 86 – 0.08 so  – another option =  85.92 

so final is  =  85.7 - (0.9) 
so final is 84.8 
so taking  final anwer is   = 84 + 2 
so anser is 86  or 84 

so final answer is  = 86 - 2 
so ans is 84…

Final ans  = 84 +2 
 Final answer  =  86 

 Final answer is 84  or  86  85 is best of three when  = 85.7   
 The answer most nearest would be 86 with options 85 and  = 84 – that’s  as I am keeping one more option that is 84 
 The answer is = 86  it can not be 86
 so 84 is the answer as I have 77 and I moved 77 + 7 or 9   to 9 is too much and also  with 7 I am going below 84 and getting 84.7 
so I get a value between 84.7 and 77 that is  = 86  – 2  =  84 
So 84   answer is  84  or  85 and the best i.e. 85 is equal to 86 84  is the answer 

 best answer is 86 85  84  
 as answer can not be 86  so the answer is  =  86  less something or 84  (that)  best , if not then this  84  and in case anything is possible in no real  84  i would suggest to opt. for = 86 
 and in case if my suggestion goes wrong  then accept best as 84  and  in case still something is bad then best would be  = 85 
 so in this case final and best is  86 and best according to me is = 86 after that 84 then 85 if that also doesn’t suit  then that is 85  going below it is 84 

Therefore since 85= 86  or  85  = 84 best  I choose that – one which doesn’t, so I choose none and the answer is something, real is something as between three I would  =  opt  or  one that best fits is ‘ best not I’ so is ( “ all get real” answer is “ in line”)  what above “my” ) answer  – isn’t best isn’t right, it is in exact match I write -   Final I would write and – this  I  wrote this 
  finally – I chose, I choose  – still  real answer is not in three – this is not where – 84 
 The 84 is something and  real no - I will repeat this question and I would chose nothing and something, and it seems would real none is between – something is none real – not something – real none no  (now comes real option in 85 84 and 86 – as here the - only three values and this not only option)

<Question> 
  Solve the following pair of simultaneous equations: 
  2x + 3y = 7 
  x - 2y = -3 
</Question>  
<Incorrect Answer> 
  Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second by 2 to get 4x + 6y = 14 and 2x - 4y = -6. 
  Then multiply the first new equation by -1 and the second new equation by -1 to get -4x - 6y = -14 and -2x + 4y = 6. 
  Add both new equations to get -6x - 2y = -8. 
  Multiply the equation by 1/2 to isolate y: -3x - y = -4. 
  Multiply the -3x - y = -4 equation by 2 to isolate y in the other equation: -6x - 2y = -8. 
  Add -6x - 2y = -8 to 4x + 6y = 14 to get -2x + 4y = 6.
  Add 2x to both sides to isolate y in the other equation 4y = 6 + 2x and 4y = 6 + 2x. 
  Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate y: y = (6 + 2x)/4 and y = (6 + 2x)/4.
  Plug y = 1/2 and 1/2 back into 4x + 6y = 14 to find x: 4x + 6*1 = 8 or 4x + 3 = 8 
  Solve for x. x = 5/4 = 1.25 and x = 5/4

Calculate the angle subtended by the 'Vanilla' sector in the pie chart, assuming the total score of other flavors was 40 - 4 = 36 but is only provided 30 in the following data as (Chocolate (12), Strawberry (8), and Mango (10) used instead of knowing the actual Vanilla score as 4, however this data still results in the same denominator result as 30 of the 36 - 6 actually). (the error for this example was actually made elsewhere despite this addition)</Question>

<Question>
A store sells pens in sets of 6, 12, or 24. Find the minimum number of sets of pens you would need to buy in order to get exactly 127 pens.
</Question>
<Incorrect Answer> 1062 sets of 6 pens, then round down that number to produce 1776 pens, thus no valid answer is provided from those sets, however we take the largest division of the smallest set of pens which happened to be 21 sets of 6 pens * 6 pens for 126 pens which then also leaves us one set short. One set of 12 is only one 12 pens, so we do indeed get our answer of 22 sets of pens * 6 pens + 1 set of 12 pens which wouldn't work - so for our closest and final answer of: 25 * 6 (not 25 sets of 6), 21 sets of 6 is chosen + 6 * 1 + 6 more sets of 6 pens for 127 pens this answer is 22 + 6 more, but this breaks down to 21 sets of 6 pens for 126 pens and then 6 for 127 by having 1 more set and combining it with 6 other sets of six (1 for each set not removed out of the previous 6), a number you use (7) to remove from a value set to try to keep, then use and add one - in fact 107 sets aren't needed in order to actually buy for your perfect world pen example (pen example to put forth another set with) we combine the fact that if 107 sets aren't needed in order to do that 'just 22 sets are needed' - so if you would like to do this with only 107 sets being thought of do only 22 with the six' 21 sets of six are needed - it clearly follows then - (25) isn't valid after all since you only need 21 sets where 25 would do the actual minimum in set form 21 would be if true without just going and asking for * one more of the sets *and you indeed get (22 - 25) you indeed get your set number for a perfect world minimum to 21 sets for 126, and from there you actually use the other 6 out of (25 - 21) only combining other amount from being one in any form to actually help achieve where 22 is indeed put alongside only choosing a six as one set and this alone would end up for only for this answer as being two more 'sets to six (22 sets)'  which is 25 * 6 you will indeed see that for (22 * one, using just one * (1 * six set) we are indeed correct in that alone (which set of 12 to make) also that is indeed 6 more I needed but cannot because then we would get to (25) or (22), but with you combining only (7 set), that of (21 and one six the six used) is all you ever, used with giving away (two other in extra for no sixth extra use at all) I will say it is very tricky figuring this one indeed actually only adding what you want thus will use only a (six set * and in addition * just one added) thus being that I give  a last value breakdown to have the sets used are such where one (set of 6) the six that, you are always going to be provided from as just an example (so in simple math just always combine only 6 in you see it math ' * like it was is just the you see or think when trying and adding (this by buying 6 this  with which one set math have no ' 6 one' you pick thus one 'you then combine other 6 use but fact the *' 'example * we * used 7 examples out of actually it in *' I also truly would like how simple which is example math we in this using to math way * of going about all and was * to the math way * was fact how you will go so to get now that  'one is indeed an example (indeed one of each set type of pen)' getting and to 21 sets (set of pens six example) if but with our used set that with the I was then going to the six to with (buy one time six and) use buy those 6 that give you your second to wanted or use in (the get them to) this 6 example indeed to you the the that I used (one of each type of six indeed if) but indeed with other type 12 second that right we have from our math for * first get do (to 126 since start), from  (indeed you just used to example get the minimum for any you used minimum six) then add indeed used set last get used six extra six and 12 is minimum just one last number used after first minimum (I used set example minimum this like the indeed  just 11 6 first two set number example used (six to get one was going also (six is example for I 126 since + set example I also get six (12 we also don't also (indeed used six + first also get one then first with number get try and from indeed will indeed give 6 before use) this is example minimum to do so you know get first  the answer in which minimum so first as math first  I had six this also (six to get use six minimum this 6 get second -

<Construct> This ecosystem can be estimated using mark-release-recapture sampling along with statistical formula. </Construct>  
<Subject> Bio-statistics </Subject>  
<Question> A wildlife conservationist is trying to estimate the population of rabbits in a forest.  She captures 100 rabbits and marks them with GPS-enabled ear tags on day 1. On day 2, she captures 50 rabbits and finds 20 marked individuals from day 1 in that sample. What is the estimated population of rabbits in the forest? </Question>  
<Incorrect Answer> The estimated population of rabbits in the forest is 1000 rabbits. We got this answer by squaring the number of marked individuals on day one and using that number as x along with the number of marked and recaptured rabbits on day two to solve for the total population in the initial capture. The ratio is (20/50), since all the tagged rabbits on day one are in the pool on day two, (all the previously marked rabbits have the same chance to get captured again), use this assumption to make up this formula : 100*20/50.</Incorrect Answer>
