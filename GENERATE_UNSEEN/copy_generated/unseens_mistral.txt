<Construct>Solve the following system of linear equations using the elimination method:</Construct>
<Question>Solve the system of equations:
\[ 3x + 4y = 12 \]
\[ 5x + 2y = 14 \]</Question>
<Correct Answer>First, multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \( y \) the same in both equations:
\[ 3x + 4y = 12 \]
\[ 10x + 4y = 28 \]
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ 7x = 16 \]
\[ x = \frac{16}{7} \]
Substitute \( x \) back into the first equation:
\[ 3\left(\frac{16}{7}\right) + 4y = 12 \]
\[ \frac{48}{7} + 4y = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 12 - \frac{48}{7} \]
\[ 4y = \frac{36}{7} \]
\[ y = \frac{9}{7} \]
So, the solution is \( x = \frac{16}{7} \) and \( y = \frac{9}{7} \).</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>Multiply both equations by the LCM of the coefficients of \( y \), which is 4:
\[ 12x + 16y = 48 \]
\[ 20x + 8y = 56 \]
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ 8x - 8y = 8 \]
\[ x - y = 1 \]
This does not lead to a solution for \( x \) and \( y \).</Incorrect Answer>
