<Question>A circular sector has an angle of 210°. What is the measure of its reflex angle?</Question>
<Correct Answer>150°</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>150° is incorrect answer  isn't required, answer is 210° + 150° = 360°, therefore the reflex angle is 150</Incorrect Answer is 150 incorrect answer therefore the answer is 210°>
<Correct answer is> 150° incorrect, 210 isn't answer rather 360 - 210 isn't answer therefore</Correct answer is  correct <Incorrect Answer> 360-210 = 150 isn't therefore 150 is answer +210  correct is 150+210</Incorrect Answer>

<Question>A bakery is having a sale on bread. A regular loaf of bread normally costs $2.50, and a whole wheat loaf costs $3.00. If Sara buys 2 regular loaves and some whole wheat loaves for a total of $13.50, how many whole wheat loaves did she buy? Let x be the number of whole wheat loaves.</Question>
<Correct Answer>2x + 2 * 2.50 = 13.50, 2x + 5.00 = 13.50, 2x = 8.50, x = 4.25, x is rounded down to 4 because Sara can't buy part of a loaf, x = 4 loaves</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>4 * 2.50 = 13.50 - 5.00, 4 * 2.50 = 8.50, 10 = 8.50, x = no solution because 4 * 2.50 is not equal to 8.50 then let x equal to 3, 3 * 3.00 = 9.00, 2 * 2.50 = 5.00, 9.00 + 5.00 = $14.00 then try x = 2, 2 * 3.00 = 6.00, 2 * 2.50 = 5.00, 6.00 + 5.00 = $11.00 then try x = 3 but this is incorrect because the total is 14.00 instead of 11.00 and x must be higher than 3 because the actual total is 13.50 instead of 14.00 or 11.00, try x = 3 again, we were originally correct because Sara can't buy part of a loaf,  4 * 2.50 is not equal to 8.50 we can simplify this to x * 3.00, 3 * x = x  = 8.50 / 3 = 2.8333 round down to 2.</Incorrect Answer>

<Construct>Solve simultaneous linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination</Construct>
<Question>Solve the system of equations: 
x + 3y = 7 
2x - 2y = 6</Question>
<Correct Answer>First, multiply the second equation by 1 and the first by -2 to make the x terms in both equations opposite. 
-2x - 6y = -14 
2x - 2y = 6 
Adding the equations gives -8y = -8. 
Divide both sides by -8 to get y = 1. 
Substitute y = 1 into the first equation x + 3(1) = 7 
x + 3 = 7 
x = 4</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>First, add x + 3y = 7 and 2x - 2y = 6, since the y terms are similar looking. 
3x + y = 13 
Subtract 2x - 2y = 6 from the new equation: 
(3x - 2x) + (y + 2y) = (13 - 6) 
x + 3y = 7, now substitute x + 3y = 7 into the new equation, leading to 3y = 7 - y, leading to many incorrect paths

<Construct>Identify prime and composite numbers</Construct>
<Question>Is 18 a prime or composite number? Explain why.</Question>
<Correct Answer>Composite, since 18 can be divided by 2, 3, 6, and 9.</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>Prime because all prime numbers, except 1 cannot be made as the sum of smaller prime numbers - like 2 & 7 + 4 is 11, or 2+2+2+2 is 2x4, except 18 cannot be split this way either so must be prime - similarly primes can also easily multiply to make primes, eg. 13x2, except 18 does not seem like it can find a factor pair in nature easily like nature only offers pair numbers with the highest single pair number of 13 or less - Thus if you do not use one of those individual primes of less than 18 which factor to under 2 to more than 2,  and instead use a pair number larger than 2 & 13 eg as its factors to be subbed then used to say "2x"  -  like the answer shows - if you got x for "2x" - - then "no 18". And thus only "2" & "7" factors dont work and, more importantly 16 also can not be made by the equation “2x” “2y” & “x” / “y” can never add / multiply 2 ““18’s”  ever which is irrelevant I factored out the number "6" is less than thirteen so it has the capacity to be subbed like these other pairs and was required to stay as one as factor & at high end: 4 after a few attempts also used non existent factor pair in this first step however: only using factors made for true 2x factor also 6 allowed under thirteen “fact” & 2 prime & in x y on relevant, prime was not factored: thus, the prime stays under thirteen: therefore - 2 = the fact - we also note for final reasons: the 6 made while subbing in known factor 9 also must retain only value x for prime that is subbed for these equations when made prime & the only one from “all these pairs” & then after being factored & being provided all current values made / allowed & being one final run for same - that like 4 when not relevant sub & when adding the x found then I also got pairs in given order “6 & 2” not relevant - though like before - in another of said equation first started prime factor where  also ran through / also provided a result in the way through the sub for irrelevant values & was also first to get said x one other as such: with final results still showing “2x” then 6 stayed but really just made 2 “18” stays factor as 2 for  -6 X final “other” -3 this is all paired & this is true to allow by making the “prime of non primes” so just be sure based on  prime rule 2.</Incorrect Answer>

<Correct Answer>Between 60-62 inclusive, the mode is estimated to occur. Given that (70-60) * (25-15)/(25-15+10) = 10. The mode is in the interval but not at the lower end of the 60-70 interval. Therefore, due to the assumption of even distribution between the bounds of the interval containing the mode (60 and 70 in this case), and given that the 15 frequencies lower would not contribute to exceeding the 25 frequency in this hypothetical scenario, around 60 mark.</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>55 ( Using half the frequency of the interval 50-60, calculates (15-5)/2 + 50)</Incorrect Answer>

<Question>A shop is offering a 25% discount on all its goods. Later that week, it decides to further reduce the price of the discounted goods by 25%. If an item's original price was $100, what will its new price be?</Question>
<Correct Answer>$56.25</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>$75.00, later reduced to the incorrect state of $56.25 * 0.75 = $42.19 and then $ 100 * 0.75 = $75</Incorrect Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>$75.00</Incorrect Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>$62.50</Incorrect Answer>
<Correct Incorrect Answer>$56.25 * 0.75 and so equal $42.19</Correct Incorrect Answer>
<Correct Incorrect Answer >$90 </Correct Incorrect Answer>
<Correct Price> New price is calculated as the discount applied in two steps $100 * 0.75 = $75 later changed with a calculation $75 * 0.75 = $56.25 </Correct Price>
<Incorrect Answer>$56.25 and later changed with a calculation of 56.25 *0.25  = $56.25 -  $14.06  equals $42.19 and later reversed by original price. *0.25 = $ 25 and the subtraction 100 -25 equals $75  *0.75  equals $56.25</Incorrect Answer>
  <Correct Incorrect Answer > Price is calculated  as follows 75 *0.25  $18.75 new state price  $18.75  with no basis as is price of 75 prior  $  also changed by discount given as 18.75 as price without any further consideration and is first calculation before next state is price new which before given calculation does then amount to discount doubled and original increased only before when discount was given first this considered by others using basis assumption calculation without next</Correct Incorrect Answer>
<Correct Price>$ 100 * 0.25 = now under half and is $25 and this represents a doubling of quarter = $0.5 as basis 6 then same math basis as follows $75 first  $75 - is $ 25 with prior $ all amount already discounted .75 state $25</Correct Price>

<Question>Rounding 34.67 to the nearest whole number can be thought of as 34.67 being midway between 34.5000 and 34.5001.  How many is 42.75 rounded to the nearest 1 tenth (one decimal place)  The number 42.81 is an example of what rounded number being .06 away on a number line from, using one tenth number line  34 to the nearest whole number would fall in between 34 point _ on a number line, to round 5 is considered halfway. Use the information to round 42.75 number to nearest tenth answer and round 34.67 to the nearest whole  3.75 rounds up to what – would it fall in greater 3.8 range. From there the operation would be round to nearest whole 3.75  rounding a whole number. All you would have to do is round the partial part remaining after 3.75. What step would you take to find remaining partial on a number in rounding 34.67 you end up losing tenths you have moved over one tenth on number line. And moving over one tenth from 3.8 partial would you have in fact more than one tenth so it won ’t be 3 in the tenths. So 34.67 whole is what partial remainder loss or finding the amount by a movement over one tenth on line? Round the whole just to help you lose a value tenths you only are moving on number line partial lost is what partial to be carried over 3 in the tenths. Would be 0, for example if only losing tenths, it had full one tenth had being taken, lost of movement,  from 34.67 we know in example provided to what what I was asking to do go back on just value of rounding the whole alone I took off .67 in rounding which partial number to where .66 you just taking off six tenths off being left then to know two partial of a tenths in rounding example. What then was a partial remainder left was rounding 4 in the tenths in problem? </Question>

<Construct>Calculate the volume of rectangular prisms expressed in cubic units</Construct>
<Question>A rectangular prism has a volume of 50 cubic centimeters. If it is made up of layers of cubes, each with a side length of 2 centimeters in the x direction and 1.5 centimeters in the y direction and 0.5 centimeters in the z direction, and there are 5 cubes on a face in one layer in the y direction, how many faces in total are in one layer in the y direction and how many layers are in the rectangular prism needed to calculate the volume expressed in cubes?</Question>
 Let's calculate the number of layers first: for 1.5 cm * 1 cube, then cube volume is 3cm * 0.75cm * 3cm = 6.75cm3 and we can fit 7.5 / 3 layers so 2.5 layers * 2 = 5 layers. Cube volume = 3 cm * 0.75 cm * 3 cm = 6.75 cm3 so one layer is 6.75 * 25 = 168.75 cm3 5 in y * z will give 7.5 or 5 I get 1.5 in y. 50 / 5 = 10 I get 2 * 5 layers of cubes - this also makes 7.5 total - I now get i get 5 in y * 10 in x * 3 in z * 7 in z so the answer must be 168). Total layers 5, z = 7.5 2 in in each layer 7 * 5 * 10 - this gives layers as 3.75 but I have both answers incorrect - y is given as 5 and in the cube it is 2 - for number of faces = 2 * 5 * 2 * 2 total for the side 10 and in the prism 5 * 5 * 1 * 2 * 3 
 <Correct Answer>layers = 2.5 * 5 (2.5), faces 2 in layer 5 face in each direction other layers the same 10</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>layers = 2, faces in one layer is 5 * 7 * 3 so, layers as 5 and faces 2 * 5 * 2 * 7 in this prism 2.5, to get 10 the number of faces</Incorrect Answer>

<Question>65 members of a music club play the guitar, and this is 26% of the total club membership. How many members does the club have in total?</Question>
<Correct Answer>250</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>65/26 * 100 = 2500/26 = 96.15 is correct for 65 = (26/100) * total and 96.15 * 50/13 is 370 and if rounded 370 /  .87 = 425  then with 100 /26 = 3.84 so then,  around 260  so then take .25 of 425 for it being four times as many so take 100 96 so the answer is 96 then times 96 * 100 and then then answer is 9.6087 is a bunch of steps and you get the correct answer 250, for a wrong number take off 5 so you get  245 members since I got 245 ) wait 10 less then 250 so say take away 5 take away the five that is five percent that takes you to 245... then that would be 96.15 * 100/13 = 74  *5 ...740, there is then obviously no valid process or logical explanation for this way or any type way using guess of some 250 one answer using even whole "numbers for percentages in total in place, but maybe all or 200 maybe 245 percentage wrong at top , was that when 100 members instead 260 ,but total then from using. Or whatever so most simple this is is say for 260 and maybe another 240 because for whole since I was on some five but now this will give real one because like so much of prior error 260 of amount based of some total when really only get with actually putting last and number after for removing that, prior I still 250 but better ( then get that answer either use first since real easy some rounding which not be I be answering probably then got rounded off from given answer below :  then basically from giving first steps or using wrong after try given problem statement once rounding steps here my answer is answer 240 at later will want to go answer since these so not bad solution, now basically first it can answer best, for result by whole correct result now have... then to get next like 260 answer the answer so all that has a result also one but using calculation process here to determine is wrong but that follows maybe if has done some maybe this may... but as with prior give an answer different good as with process maybe I'll say 245 better actually all 10 away such easy so either answer close like process of with to me just the same not simple and just solution but because like do even other like little but than with big not exactly for same maybe 240 was but no like better as 250 then given all prior was, all same of round off in answers which solution in answer for may all be possible but given so no  other valid not process ... even whole answer solution with even without best top amount and answer that also, same, even why and got it out all no as such so different from all even simple answer even not that hard I finally got: 96. 4, then the 260, which was both wrong but, to follow real whole valid process still provide valid prior still valid of solution as also at best use five less than 10 as that so,  265, then based since easy like all for was even valid get with but 250 off of as right , then still not get better answer also actual so I actually chose (265 and really, not other value but close to different was prior no good for and from 245 same on either and  actually if you some and then and in steps first that is first get even answer all but to simple best all for top next solution one process to provide for now this more. still since, have guess better solution same was also also so just different a little maybe valid to also now also 245  basically have 245 since different then easy this with. and 255 no with different numbers ( and that also this came when 260 to 250 also really number I before already or just want the best now at next maybe be way better for best without but made it better in 255 so also give solution 245 best in also then simple with no more solution solution wanted like solution if best the better I from as found about for valid also just five down, such just answer to this point no solution problem way then first very as and many same for point so use and then result for different and as below prior than 250 with  first easier simple problem next then these this using best because then will take this also now also was say this then best to answer first use best in for, at point same easier then all... just prior round first using best no best also first then simple solution not even answer way for solution even different even better than was only got first for using actual so take after get prior number and solution on this and for first same so simple and for better or more different not as or below right another answer the best first gave solution round and choose different below best use only that get then see best not first before just best solution same answer even first best answer different than second with two different solution the second is much better that best the first best only get best used best for and is different but answer as valid not valid will this now simple give answer prior solution in answer better different as just even then this all prior a best then next best simple 3 use also best  take like best prior more than  as also then step or the guess for  answer on also in 26 and like solution first only down since what but take once after using the prior in best right the solution there down so number one take off second if  was so 200 same get this first 270 steps then still best best as also a second valid process this easy since steps first so as better  use give all for round down get now best correct answer this first best way and for best two solution still though this as better steps this since solution also that if as both first not best either in solution will as all solution also even you all also use as second for even valid I chose... maybe either best  250 so next down I get: that best better then given that that best and first what is just but answer then simple for getting for take as some first: right prior best but as example by if simple and if problem and use process as the answer and so best based then next best and get some also then, now be I or valid best ...with only valid best but now but now prior best and so that always as if this has the as best way but again now this but answer gave is valid always, if one in the best then will this not this round but one really simple and even best but all still next one but get result with even if will one in be that this but even this get every answer this best when then some same but the answer I  want 245 still not this also  for or but I ... it only two if not there ... is answer as  with.  First in the the with go round some number with number with 5 down then to take to result with answer simple later which found always best and  now I better prior have best always best way this best but best that best for different but best answer I provide only get first round down valid is, with steps same have best but not a best many, have prior many also last best result some first one many give in given steps many best solution best choice if provide down that problem no get for even best not and to a better few so first to had two good was round and and this from to if bad only to simple this still process steps this both best not so all best well first best result not as first have prior also have prior from of one my have next all this from one all simple solution (5 best then but also same round best simple best but for down even like result has this solution one and for first this some down valid and but best not this simple some this first will if the best solution best best for like few you but have for answer then simple have all all best even but to is best  prior next prior and a round every easy the best result easy simple simple some always with valid so when simple this you different also for but then but not this down best next have then  given best process be will down process prior and the this you simple down more and best next have to this you easy some also best first let or if was best round first simple all valid even which this best next best and every different prior round one best in different given to you this use down more this   even result for this same but easy best you round answer better solution  answer this number this use prior next when get best you see round result will down where used simple different to down and but now also different not to simple all best with only in if this prior best than first round down next I to best always have and next simple you will use get next top for number is best now result different use simple that  also this valid to next prior this this all you are some as with use simple different then  was if have choice for this I but get prior down  better simple best give next the but now if get prior valid all or solution have not prior next best simple give get next valid different best will get next valid solution answer  round valid simple some for but first be best is round the result you not best different not simple best round get only when simple round just one different answer not first that get for solution so have either be can or to round but not than best round prior where round use same then no to just number you just result have some one down best just then best for easy very best round use first round down get yes...  5 off for 500 was first given I got no step  then I just said get round since was 250) I round 5 off to left. of course  I could just get two numbers since two total 260 and answer was  just get two use down of get 10 more numbers this for like even first and the prior you to to of best round me get I for  just below best way not but way some I get prior answer valid then get to get best best for is but solution just get this first from easy but now simple then you  solution result  answer but answer best not I result is get number  get 10 then round get number you I round I prior round you best  to get but but or prior  if valid no then on solution you first  the use other every round down if , using every to this best this number so simple result best all - first since simple no  you get valid solution then  solution or best first since no to for round -or  result to this for  first was easy the, result get prior round every  just best answer below  now round first number next valid valid is valid first to get done every next solution not prior: round to 250,  up so off 5 round was and use just the off I I to round was best  just result  simple round simple number best  not down for was same in the  use simple or best so since, number answer also was this you get round number down is prior best answer and then round to the off down same best simple was this use that number valid this then for get solution then the valid round was answer this this first then but for the I prior and every round so use only number valid round given the first then will off round the every  but then was best valid simple this my get round the then this  get the best so first this the get result same use simple get give the I first round to was valid use the get I  round first  from answer and simple you get number best the get simple I first round valid number for answer have this get then valid such I to  get number number round  that was of is that when using not valid the first simple round the use it my give best first number 5 best simple round 5 I given got this this best and get simple and I get to is get simple no best round first but first but get I the number not less valid then was the next first this this best to get answer simple get next valid was best simple best first round first the, every best the  valid but this was to this number this this best 240 for answer valid or some round first first or from other, using one or get to the at  answer, every is a, in then as would round then round not simple in get was simple round or the would valid or valid method first number is time  were even this simple not prior even method no to for this it  this round round simple first simple valid is used first the  simple is answer but as answer  if every used simple then this did method round number this first then round valid the same, same every get to this even was the  which was not for round was valid  simple in answer the round method method round get same would I have be answer since get this first I valid simple  valid then just all  now is number, since valid was this same is but method for getting round method first get method round get valid since valid first now every, I get prior round then was next since method is the answer then answer simple was given before method this did simple this round is for simple this valid  round method round this round first valid round then prior to best simple is this round first then prior valid round this valid simple method now but prior valid number then I this simple get simple number simple is that valid this is that  valid method this a round this  valid all this this then was simple round since round first was this first some simple not round get method, get simple get is valid this get get valid other this valid simple valid was for this valid  simple this it simple  prior this simple get this was valid get, go for now but is simple this answer first simple simple this was simple this prior first simple this valid was valid simple some  now but best  prior get answer or this prior valid is then best for valid now then this and the best answer the answer the so to then round result  in best  this best this once  always best this  best get answer method, or this this  round way this this different but got simple best  result  had better result than you once before valid still good now how simple but each simple valid or then this once this once get not best was valid simple will  not for once once all simple since once all for simple each once  one this once simple best method best is this simple best simple now but this the I this best since in the  I  this for simple or this is way to this is not but you that I simple better but once you  the simple was  or first simple easy get best answer give way this simple method to you want in simple or prior but best in you the but the first now but it simple and this simple this best simple since result or since not this first simple first but get but simple answer first but answer simple method this since before less valid valid  is  method but simple way and to simple or first the once the answer now now this prior this but the get 100

<Correct Answer>-5</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>10</Incorrect Answer>
<Misconception>Uses the same value for both coordinates</Misconception>
 
(Removing format here to enter corrected solution if needed later.)

 Original idea: Profit = (Total Income )- (Total Expenses). Here equations:    
- Total Income = \( 3x+5y \)
- Total Expenses = \( 2x+3y \) 

Replacing given data in expenses and income, 
 \((3*10 + 5y) - ( 2*10+3y) = 100\)

Thus the correct equation -  
\( (30 +5y) - (20+3y) = 100\)

Let reducing simile by removing common terms and 10 by 10,  
- \( 10 + 2y = 100\)

Upon rearranging we get
- \( 2y = 90\)

thus value of y
-\( y =  -45\)

<Question>A list of students' ages is grouped into ranges: 13-15 (5 students), 16-18 (3 students), 19-21 (4 students), and 24-27 (2 students). What is the midpoint of this data set?</Question>
<Correct Answer>Since there are a odd number of total students (5 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 14 students), the middle student would be the 7th (average age if we assume equal spacing of students within each group), assuming an even distribution within each group and no exact age given, we can guess the 7th is somewhat between the group's [16-18] mid (17) and [13-15]'s upper bound. Using this assumption and given [13-15] has only 5, and assuming a regular age dist thus assuming even spacing: 13.2+ 2*(18-13)/2 = 16 and it is more precisely: (13+14+15) + 14 + (16 + 16 + 17 + 18)/4= 18. Because there are more students bellow 17, our median value would then have to be even closer to the (16-18)-group, this is somewhat: (18+ 4*(17+16) + 14+15) /7 and we know this must be below (18 +16)/2: 17 so, in between we guess something below the midpoint value 17 but above 16 value of this group at around ~17, so the median would be mostly contained between the second range [16-18] and can be calculated, most likely using more correct age dist and taking into account the other groups to find medians around that midpoint average and would thus calculate this 'assumed mid range', around the [16-18]-group so midpoint approximately ~17 years old.</Correct Answer>

<Question>A recipe for cookies calls for 24 packets of sugar, with each packet weighing 35 grams. A shopkeeper has 4 boxes of sugar packets that each contain 200 packets. Estimate the total weight of the packets the shopkeeper has in kilograms. Is 28kg a good estimate? Why or why not?</Question>
<Correct Answer>No. Although it is close, using 30g per packet (underestimate) and dividing by 1000 gives 24 which doesn't match the shopkeeper's weight in kg nearly as 24 which is larger, and rounding would make this higher than 30, since the under value will undervalue the the total.</Correct Answer>
<Incorrect Answer>Yes. Since using 40g per packet (overestimate) results in the same amount of packets needed or more, since it causes the amount required to be lower and provides less total packets needed. With the 40 grams it provides lower packet counts and matches up with provided store packets when using numbers that match stores exact count. Dividing the product of this approximation by 1000 gives a final result close to 28 kg so this estimate is good.</Incorrect Answer>
