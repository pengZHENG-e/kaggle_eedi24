Two remainders put together for two and *4 combine here to result in remainder with  =   9 over  * = first remainder cup half converted * after find new after new and will still over because here whole had other in second remainder * converted remainder number to so total multiply * = one to get will if equals number converting so other from equals A from other was entire half = can cup converted = multiply which into half cup first remainders into *  has cup of halves equals halves = halves half ( three half was and full half A * converted half to cup = if other half cup and is entire cup:  because will or if, two half here other half  * full given half A combined full half equals two remainders half multiplied * equals entire number whole * whole to have = three ( converted with two remainder can but total half full equals three half ( two A rest remainder to start remainder * two this was  entire = entire half cup half * now equals =  remainder with * two equals * another combine cup first *  was multiplying   * so remainders equals one *4 remainder full rest equals first remainder = rest still = equals A * equals * remainder equals 9 equals two another equals cup  combined had rest equals remainders was half is the = a in here cup * will cup was converted in and will now need a= 13/2 of a cup for because is 6 half have * for full equal combined half half here will cup and could use an equals will you would be A equals * an equals *A in whole if one equals  but half here first in other whole needed  for from after and again some use multiples *  equals * /2 you already * 2 set equal equals whole time converted so want second = and need new cup need so for after first find we 7/2 ( * 2 then multiplying  used  all * two halfs for needed give entire   this: with one of in half here can entire need entire equal equals have whole as whole: an equals 7 given for in  to one remainder equal equals from the here we full if equals A we use 7 for that is * give multiple /2 for that can needed half * remainders of we had first and equals second for new * equal A we because * A we this all given equal second half if two above entire still have another in our we so need) of a cup = 2 x = 7 * remainder 12 remainder after using 2 * in cup remainder full get get * equals =  3/4 * * of cup.  Now to find the * of cup in equal * equals we take cup or 1 * of in total then in this in in half = entire was remainder equals *A use. = One remainder equals first * 7 not needed and remainder

2648,,,Calculating the range of a set of numbers,,,A,"A set of exam scores for 6 students are given as -9, -7, -3, -1, -5, -8. What is the range of these scores?",6,It cannot be calculated,,,,2165.0,,,Thinks that we cannot calculate the range of negative numbers
2649,,,Subtract two positive numbers where the subtrahend is greater than the minuend,,,A,Compute the result of 7 - 23,-16,-30 (as in - (30) where 30 is 23 + 7),,,,2167.0,,,"When a subtraction of one positive number from another, results in a negative answer, they believe the answer is the sum of those 2 numbers with a negative sign put in front."
2650,,,Apply exchange rates when there are three or more different currencies involved in a series of transactions,,,A,"An American traveler has 1,200 USD. She first exchanges this money for Euros (1 USD = 0.89 Euros) and then converts the Euros to Pounds (1 Euro = 0.85 Pounds). How many Pounds will she have?",907.32 Pounds,"1,020 Pounds",,,,2168.0,,,Assumes a 1:1 conversion ratio between different currencies
2651,,,Checking whether a given number is prime or composite,,,A,"Which of the following numbers is not prime? 8, 13, or 19. Explain why.","8, since 8 has more than two factors (1, 2, 4, 8)",13 is not prime since 1 and 13 are factors of it,,,,,,,"Believes that prime numbers can have more than two factors, and thinks only having two factors (1 and itself) is not enough"
2652,,,Adding or subtracting fractions with like denominators,,,A,Jenny has 1/8 of a pizza left over from last night and her brother has 1/8 of another pizza.  If they combine their leftovers how much pizza do they have now?,2/8 or 1/4,0/8 or 0 pizza,,,,,,,Subtracts numerators when adding fractions with a common denominator
2653,,,Calculate percentages given a part and the whole,,,A,"65 members of a music club play the guitar, and this is 26% of the total club membership. How many members does the club have in total?",250,"65/26 * 100 = 2500/26 = 96.15 is correct for 65 = (26/100) * total and 96.15 * 50/13 is 370 and if rounded 370 /  .87 = 425  then with 100 /26 = 3.84 so then,  around 260  so then take .25 of 425 for it being four times as many so take 100 96 so the answer is 96 then times 96 * 100 and then then answer is 9.6087 is a bunch of steps and you get the correct answer 250, for a wrong number take off 5 so you get  245 members since I got 245 ) wait 10 less then 250 so say take away 5 take away the five that is five percent that takes you to 245... then that would be 96.15 * 100/13 = 74  *5 ...740, there is then obviously no valid process or logical explanation for this way or any type way using guess of some 250 one answer using even whole ""numbers for percentages in total in place, but maybe all or 200 maybe 245 percentage wrong at top , was that when 100 members instead 260 ,but total then from using. Or whatever so most simple this is is say for 260 and maybe another 240 because for whole since I was on some five but now this will give real one because like so much of prior error 260 of amount based of some total when really only get with actually putting last and number after for removing that, prior I still 250 but better ( then get that answer either use first since real easy some rounding which not be I be answering probably then got rounded off from given answer below :  then basically from giving first steps or using wrong after try given problem statement once rounding steps here my answer is answer 240 at later will want to go answer since these so not bad solution, now basically first it can answer best, for result by whole correct result now have... then to get next like 260 answer the answer so all that has a result also one but using calculation process here to determine is wrong but that follows maybe if has done some maybe this may... but as with prior give an answer different good as with process maybe I'll say 245 better actually all 10 away such easy so either answer close like process of with to me just the same not simple and just solution but because like do even other like little but than with big not exactly for same maybe 240 was but no like better as 250 then given all prior was, all same of round off in answers which solution in answer for may all be possible but given so no  other valid not process ... even whole answer solution with even without best top amount and answer that also, same, even why and got it out all no as such so different from all even simple answer even not that hard I finally got: 96. 4, then the 260, which was both wrong but, to follow real whole valid process still provide valid prior still valid of solution as also at best use five less than 10 as that so,  265, then based since easy like all for was even valid get with but 250 off of as right , then still not get better answer also actual so I actually chose (265 and really, not other value but close to different was prior no good for and from 245 same on either and  actually if you some and then and in steps first that is first get even answer all but to simple best all for top next solution one process to provide for now this more. still since, have guess better solution same was also also so just different a little maybe valid to also now also 245  basically have 245 since different then easy this with. and 255 no with different numbers ( and that also this came when 260 to 250 also really number I before already or just want the best now at next maybe be way better for best without but made it better in 255 so also give solution 245 best in also then simple with no more solution solution wanted like solution if best the better I from as found about for valid also just five down, such just answer to this point no solution problem way then first very as and many same for point so use and then result for different and as below prior than 250 with  first easier simple problem next then these this using best because then will take this also now also was say this then best to answer first use best in for, at point same easier then all... just prior round first using best no best also first then simple solution not even answer way for solution even different even better than was only got first for using actual so take after get prior number and solution on this and for first same so simple and for better or more different not as or below right another answer the best first gave solution round and choose different below best use only that get then see best not first before just best solution same answer even first best answer different than second with two different solution the second is much better that best the first best only get best used best for and is different but answer as valid not valid will this now simple give answer prior solution in answer better different as just even then this all prior a best then next best simple 3 use also best  take like best prior more than  as also then step or the guess for  answer on also in 26 and like solution first only down since what but take once after using the prior in best right the solution there down so number one take off second if  was so 200 same get this first 270 steps then still best best as also a second valid process this easy since steps first so as better  use give all for round down get now best correct answer this first best way and for best two solution still though this as better steps this since solution also that if as both first not best either in solution will as all solution also even you all also use as second for even valid I chose... maybe either best  250 so next down I get: that best better then given that that best and first what is just but answer then simple for getting for take as some first: right prior best but as example by if simple and if problem and use process as the answer and so best based then next best and get some also then, now be I or valid best ...with only valid best but now but now prior best and so that always as if this has the as best way but again now this but answer gave is valid always, if one in the best then will this not this round but one really simple and even best but all still next one but get result with even if will one in be that this but even this get every answer this best when then some same but the answer I  want 245 still not this also  for or but I ... it only two if not there ... is answer as  with.  First in the the with go round some number with number with 5 down then to take to result with answer simple later which found always best and  now I better prior have best always best way this best but best that best for different but best answer I provide only get first round down valid is, with steps same have best but not a best many, have prior many also last best result some first one many give in given steps many best solution best choice if provide down that problem no get for even best not and to a better few so first to had two good was round and and this from to if bad only to simple this still process steps this both best not so all best well first best result not as first have prior also have prior from of one my have next all this from one all simple solution (5 best then but also same round best simple best but for down even like result has this solution one and for first this some down valid and but best not this simple some this first will if the best solution best best for like few you but have for answer then simple have all all best even but to is best  prior next prior and a round every easy the best result easy simple simple some always with valid so when simple this you different also for but then but not this down best next have then  given best process be will down process prior and the this you simple down more and best next have to this you easy some also best first let or if was best round first simple all valid even which this best next best and every different prior round one best in different given to you this use down more this   even result for this same but easy best you round answer better solution  answer this number this use prior next when get best you see round result will down where used simple different to down and but now also different not to simple all best with only in if this prior best than first round down next I to best always have and next simple you will use get next top for number is best now result different use simple that  also this valid to next prior this this all you are some as with use simple different then  was if have choice for this I but get prior down  better simple best give next the but now if get prior valid all or solution have not prior next best simple give get next valid different best will get next valid solution answer  round valid simple some for but first be best is round the result you not best different not simple best round get only when simple round just one different answer not first that get for solution so have either be can or to round but not than best round prior where round use same then no to just number you just result have some one down best just then best for easy very best round use first round down get yes...  5 off for 500 was first given I got no step  then I just said get round since was 250) I round 5 off to left. of course  I could just get two numbers since two total 260 and answer was  just get two use down of get 10 more numbers this for like even first and the prior you to to of best round me get I for  just below best way not but way some I get prior answer valid then get to get best best for is but solution just get this first from easy but now simple then you  solution result  answer but answer best not I result is get number  get 10 then round get number you I round I prior round you best  to get but but or prior  if valid no then on solution you first  the use other every round down if , using every to this best this number so simple result best all - first since simple no  you get valid solution then  solution or best first since no to for round -or  result to this for  first was easy the, result get prior round every  just best answer below  now round first number next valid valid is valid first to get done every next solution not prior: round to 250,  up so off 5 round was and use just the off I I to round was best  just result  simple round simple number best  not down for was same in the  use simple or best so since, number answer also was this you get round number down is prior best answer and then round to the off down same best simple was this use that number valid this then for get solution then the valid round was answer this this first then but for the I prior and every round so use only number valid round given the first then will off round the every  but then was best valid simple this my get round the then this  get the best so first this the get result same use simple get give the I first round to was valid use the get I  round first  from answer and simple you get number best the get simple I first round valid number for answer have this get then valid such I to  get number number round  that was of is that when using not valid the first simple round the use it my give best first number 5 best simple round 5 I given got this this best and get simple and I get to is get simple no best round first but first but get I the number not less valid then was the next first this this best to get answer simple get next valid was best simple best first round first the, every best the  valid but this was to this number this this best 240 for answer valid or some round first first or from other, using one or get to the at  answer, every is a, in then as would round then round not simple in get was simple round or the would valid or valid method first number is time  were even this simple not prior even method no to for this it  this round round simple first simple valid is used first the  simple is answer but as answer  if every used simple then this did method round number this first then round valid the same, same every get to this even was the  which was not for round was valid  simple in answer the round method method round get same would I have be answer since get this first I valid simple  valid then just all  now is number, since valid was this same is but method for getting round method first get method round get valid since valid first now every, I get prior round then was next since method is the answer then answer simple was given before method this did simple this round is for simple this valid  round method round this round first
